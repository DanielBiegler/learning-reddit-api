WolfKid,1509305476.0,526,"They never demonstrated that they werent getting served cat food ads to begin with...

If not it seems like it would require collusion from Apple."
agildehaus,1509315714.0,172,"I'm an iOS developer.  This video is complete bullshit.  He has knowledge of what ad was on his screen the last time he opened the app and makes the entire video around it.

Both iOS and Android are extremely restrictive about what is allowed to run in the background.  This is so they can put the CPU and various other chips into idle modes that barely use power or turn them off entirely.  When you hit your home button or let your phone sleep, an app has ~10-20 seconds before it's suspended.  There are exceptions:  apps which declare certain background modes.  They're listed [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/iPhoneOSKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009252-SW22).

It's pretty easy to see what background modes the Facebook app has.  You just download the IPA and look at the UIBackgroundModes key in the app's Info.plist file.  If it recorded audio in the background, it would have to have the ""audio"" background mode.

I just downloaded and extracted the Info.plist from the Facebook IPA.  Here's what they declare:

> <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
>    <array>
>      <string>location</string>
>      <string>fetch</string>
>      <string>remote-notification</string>
>      <string>bluetooth-central</string>
>    </array>

No audio background mode is listed.  So they're not recording you constantly because the operating system would restrict that if they tried.

Could it listen to you when the app is in the foreground?  Sure, just as any app could after you accept the microphone permissions prompt.  Facebook says they're not doing this and I rather trust them because of the PR nightmare it would cause if they actually were (it'd be rather simple to see if the app is making calls to AVAudioSession). But this video is implying that it's listening to you constantly during the day, which took two minutes to find is bullshit."
splashbodge,1509305597.0,461,yeh i'm not convinced.  I'd rather someone sniffed traffic on the phone to see if it is actually listening on the mic.  for a start is the mic even active on the phone when the screen is locked and off? Sounds like a huge security vulnerability if the OS allows apps to record conversations when in background... I'm sure this can be torn apart to prove on the technical level its doing it rather than the hearsay

We didn't get to see the ads before the test, we're not sure if they really only talked about cat food.

InquisitiveIngwer,1509314919.0,23,"This was done in an amazingly unscientific way and helps to prove nothing, but the tin foil train keeps upvoting it to the top of the front page.

Very doubtful."
D14BL0,1509305632.0,3865,"Yeah, this is bunk. iOS doesn't allow mic access like this. It would also be a TON of bandwidth that the user would definitely notice if it was pulling audio from your conversations. 

As of yet, nobody has managed to find any conclusive proof that this sort of data has been sent to Facebook via audio. At all. Zero evidence. 

Facebook has a *billion* ways they gather data on you. They don't need to spend the resources into voice recognition and dodging of legal issues by listening to your conversations. Stop believing anecdotes."
vanewho,1509312086.0,72,"I JUST posted this on another thread but here you go:

For all of you on this thread saying that you've noticed ads for things that you mention out loud you should check what apps have the permission to use the microphone on your devices and disable the ones that aren't necessary. 

We need to be proactive about our privacy. Both newer iOS and Android versions have the capability to do this. 

And don't use the Facebook app! Disable it or remove it from your phones. Android doesn't let me completely remove it so I've at least disabled it. "

phoenixtrs,1509338562.0,4,"So I understand the fear/concern with this one I really do but from certain points of view it's just the way the cookie crumbles. Facebook wouldn't be able to give you a free social media platform that you can sign up for without selling out to advertisers for money to pay for their costs. 

To me though you as user do have a small semblance of power here's what I did as an Android User.
WARNING you'll be doing some tinkering in various settings of Facebook, your phone, and your Google account tied to your phone.

**Disabling/Modifying Facebook Ad Settings**

1) Log into your Facebook profile on a desktop computer and click on the arrow in the top right. Click on ""Settings"" in the dropdown.

2) You'll get to the settings screen of your profile. In the left hand bar click on ""Ads"".

3) You'll be met with a nice screen outlining your interests based on posts you've liked/commented on. As well as any public groups you maybe a part of or any pages you like/follow.

4) Click on the Your Information tab, this tab shows you the information you're sharing outright with advertisers and third party apps/games that you may be associated with on Facebook. 

Start ticking the stuff off that you don't want to share. 

5) Click on the Your Categories tab within the ""You Information"" dropdown. Here's where you see how Facebook categorizes you and your actions that you've taken thus far -- all this being shared with advertisers and third parties. You can start crossing these out by hitting the ""X"" next to each one of them.

Just a note more may popup later so I'd visit this page/screen every month at least.

7) Next lets click on the ""Ad Settings"" dropdown here you'll find permissions essentially that are given to Facebook to show ads based on certain things. It'll give you a detailed explanation I recommend setting them all to Off - No - No One

Modifying these settings should help you get rid of personalized ads first and foremost that you might be seeing on your newsfeed after browsing amazon or some other retail sites and then returning to Facebook.



**Toning Down Facebook's Access to your Device**

Now that you've done that lets get to disabling Messenger/Facebook permission on your phone the following is what I currently own

Nextbit Robin
Android Nougat - Running Nova home screen app.

1) Pull up the list of all your apps and click on settings.

2) Under the section **Device** you should see a link with a little android icon called **Apps**

3) Scroll through and find Messenger after clicking on it you should find a screen that lists out a bunch of information concerning how much storage and data it's used up on your device etc.

What matters is the Permissions - tap that and you should see a screen of all the apps/features/hardware that the app has access to manipulate, pull data from etc.

Start toggling off all the ones you don't mind the app having.

Once you're done hit the back button, find the Facebook app within that screen and perform step 3 for that app.

You should start seeing less ads based on the things you say, apps you interact with on your phone, and things you search for.

This does mean though that if you're a power user of messenger sending vids, adding things to your story, sending pictures from your phone or taking them with the messenger app you'll have to restore some of these permissions to be able to perform that feature.

As you can see Facebook for even the most mundane features asks for your permission but doesn't really tell you what else it might be doing with that permission it simply asks you in the moment ""Hey you wanna take a picture and send it to your friends, no problem just give us permission to use you camera"" and voila they're in.

In the end this doesn't really stop Facebook from much of anything if they want to do things under the table as you can kind of see them skirting privacy standards or heavily invading it depending on how you look at it.

But I figured I'd post what I know to give you all some kind of sense of something to do in this situation. Especially to those not being able to afford the more privacy focused phones or simply not willing to go that route to have an obscure phone while they're friends and family are running around with the more common devices.

As an Android user I also found it beneficial to consider looking at the gmail account attached to the phone and revoking certain permissions and modifying certain ad settings when it comes to google which they pester me all the time to turn back on but I won't.

Great thread so far, keep spreading information to each other about this stuff the more that's out there and the more action you take as an individual the better :). "
SecretlyLovesEvery1,1509347645.0,5,"Every element of your life is recorded as data and stored in databases by a range of companies legally and illegally depending on the company/recording method.

The only limiting factor is storage. Otherwise you just get billed by your isp/4g provider for them collecting the data and life goes on.

Most of it will never need to be released, but consider the fact that you and everyone you know carries around a gps-enabled microphone that also serves also as their primary method of gathering/sending information and either primary or secondary method of communicating with others and purchasing products.

Advertising is a big deal because of the influence the ads have on you, but think of what else one can do with this data...

Predict/engineer markets

Inform hiring (e.g. she interviewed well, but data indicates she suffers from depression)

Then think about what you could do about these types of information collected from billions of people coupled with machine learning techniques over decades... Namely, correlate predictions and existing data to expected behavior, then check those predictions against future data to learn from the process, multiple times per day every day for every person. It's actually pretty amazing, although most of us won't benefit from it or even notice...

Ultimately, I think these applications will function (and already to do an extent) similarly to PageRank: by reducing the amount of time it takes for you to get where you'd have ended up probabilistically.

We mostly have to take it on faith that our data is not being recorded all the time, but regardless of the law, that is an illogical assumption to make. We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg because some asshat at Facebook got sloppy.

Just sayin'."

think_inside_the_box,1509316124.0,6,"I hate to be the voice of reason here, but this is not happening.

Unless Apple decided to say ""fuck it"" and let an exception through so FB could destroy our battery lives, there is no way to write an app that accesses background audio without showing a banner across the top of the phone screen. They could do it in-app if they request microphone usage though (but your phone should still get noticeably warm).

Note that ""hey siri"" is very optimized for that single phrase and *still* gets disabled when in low battery mode. Theres good reason apple would not let apps do this even beyond privacy concerns.

nzrocker,1509315621.0,3,"Facebook marketer here. I think *attribution error* is occurring. Yes, Facebook ""listens"" in terms of understanding and mapping your interests and behaviour, that of your friends and the content you engage with. When I create ads for clients I can get incredibly targeted, a very basic example; IOS version, smart device model, education level, 10 mile radius of an address - and whether or not you've engaged with my clients content in the past. Where it get's even more in depth is I can then create 'look alike"" audiences based on adsets I create, meaning that I can get ads in front of people who have never engaged with my client's content but whom match the 'average' profile based on the audience who does engage. It's hard to fathom the scale of just how much data is being crunched, but working with Facebook everyday on behalf of numerous businesses certainly makes me skeptical about Facebook needing to literally ""listen"" in order to serve content to users so effectively that they think they're being ""spied on"".

doommoose43,1509319137.0,3,"I hold the firm belief that modern advertising technology and techniques are unethical and immoral.  Our daily lives are inundated with advertising, subtle and obvious, with technology serving to invade your privacy and influence your behavior, with no real way to fully prevent them from appearing (I talk about ad blockers in a few paragraphs).  

Taking a step back, it almost seems like subliminal messaging or some other kind of manipulation.  It's like having to sit through a pyramid scheme presentation/meeting thing when you only went there for the food.  You're forced to sit and listen to people whom you find annoying talk about something you could care less about, just so you can enjoy some content afterwards.  And now, with modern technology and data mining, those people giving the presentation know what's been going on in my life, and now tailor their presentation to better manipulate me.  It's ridiculous.  

Now, I know that my metaphor isn't exact, I know that the data collection isn't monitored by humans, and it's likely that no human actually bothers to look at anyone's data, but the fact that it's even collected and stored is scary.  What if someone *was* looking to learn everything about me, to find out where i lived, what my interests were, my daily schedule, what I talked about, even what  I sounded like? Who knows what kind of damage someone with access to a data mining center could do.  

Even worse, the people providing the devices are now integrating into the devices data collection tools for the specific purpose of advertizing.  I've only glanced at some of the TOS and privacy policy stuff for Samsung's galaxy s8 Bixby service, and I almost immediately started disabling all bixby related stuff I could find.  How much longer is it going to be before there are literally no other ways to own a phone or computer without all of your personal data being collected? In twenty years, could I find a single carrier or phone manufacturer that won't monitor what I'm saying 24/7, searching for keywords or phrases just so they can try to sell me more stuff? This is what scares me.

All things said, even if it turns out to be confirmation bias, some of the questions I brought up are still valid.  When does data mining become an invasion of personal privacy? To what lengths are advertising companies willing to go to serve ads that generate purchases? Can content exist without it being walled behind or served alongside advertisements? 

[on adblockers].  They're really only for desktops, and most advertising is going to be served on mobile devices.  "

We talked about some sources like the Boston globe, the Washington post, and the New York Times.

This has happened with other things too, and the ads get very eerily specific. Ie, talking about Oreos, then talking about a favorite actress. Then seeing an ad with the same actress promoting Oreos. "

I worked for a website called Clickworker, and we used a system called the UHRS, Universal Human Relevance System.

Through the system we would be able to complete small tasks to earn money. Those tasks ranged from predicting a users intent when entering search results, to things like voice recognition.

We would get snippets of conversation and we were told to transcript the clip to improve their recognition software.

Very quickly I realized that most snippets people did not realize they were being recorded. And many of them involved phrases like what they used in this video, ""we need to get x"" or ""we're out of x"".

Microsoft's Kinect in particular is constantly recording and deleting your mic audio. Good thing they're not making it anymore.

That night, sure enough, instagram decided I should see ads about similar services and opportunities on my feed.

Now, either Instagram (I don't have FB) is in fact listening, or this could be happening:

The phones at the table all have GPS enabled. The phones ""know"" because of the instagram connections that we are all sitting together (or the phones can reasonably assume). The guy who was talking about the car wraps also searched for or types in queries/texts/shares/etc car wrap related things often enough that the phones make another assumption about our time together - that he would bring car wraps up at the table.

I deleted facebook 3 years ago and don't miss it one bit. 

People under age 30 and especially under age 20 will likely never be able to cut the cord to FB. Social media has completely ruined thousands of years of human interaction and how we form social bonds virtually overnight.

People were never meant to have 5000 friends. From the start of civilization up until about 1995, people had a family, one or two close friends, a handful of regular friends, and maybe a dozen acquaintances. Thats it. You shared intimate life events with your friends person to person. You spent time with them, you shared in their happiness and sorrow. 

Now, people exist to impress 5000 FB friends or potentially millions of instagram followers. People are totally numb to it. Because everyone is numb, it takes increasingly shocking and controversial acts or opinions to impress people and get likes. 

People develop depression over the shit. You stare at other people's highlight reel 24/7 and compare it to your humdrum life. Some guy you hardly know had a killer trip to China, man, he how is he living such a crazy exciting life? Well, he DIDNT post the long 60 hour weeks he had to work to afford that trip. Its a farse.

Meanwhile, he's staring at your profile and thinking the same thing. Its a lose-lose for everyone.

However, nobody will heed this advice, and younger folk will be further driven to a detached state of social interaction, yet be addicted to the attention they get. Nobody will care, facebook won't do anything, and even if they did, how the fuck would you know?"

Go to permissions in the window that opens and turn off the microphone permission.

Additional tests recommended:

Data consideration prior to tests: Do a similar test with new accounts that you don't post until all subsequent tests are completed. To be perfectly honest you may need different devices connected to unique IPs as well.
-why? Once FB sees this they may react specifically to your account, IP, or device

With that said here's what to do next to make this potentially more creepy than it already is...

1. Do the same behavior with previously unspoken about things on a device with the application closed in the background
-why? This may show something unbelievable and extremely surprising. It could displace that even when apps are closed some apps may still be accessing your mic. (Unlikely but interesting)

2. Repeat the speech test with access to mic deselected. 
-why? This would be the creepiest situation possible because if there is not access given and they are listening ... they are violating MILLIONS of users by accessing data when they were explicitly restricted from.

We then started rambling about how Facebook is spying on us for 10-20 mins, and guess what? We started getting page suggestions ""They're watching you"" ""The govermenent is listening to your conversations"", ""Privacy"" ""VPN"" ads and ""Anonymous"" related topics


All of the topics showed up as ads and suggestions on at least one phone, nothing appeared on the ""control"" phone. None of us ever talked about or searched anything about these things.


It became so annoying that it would pick up on small random things id talk about with family at dinner.


And ever since I turned off all microphone access. IT ALL STOPPED, Sometimes I turn on mic. for messenger video chat and if i forget to turn it off again, I start getting ads.

First we don't see what ads are popping up before they start talking about catfood, I know showing your Facebook stream is kind of dangerous on a video about privacy but we do need to see what ads are currently being targeted at you as a control before the study starts.  Even better use two phones for the days leading up to it, spam searches for an item in FB and Google until you see both phones are synced on what ads are showing.  Now remove the battery of your control phone, now open Facebook and put it in the background.  Do nothing else with your phone but talk into it about cat food, or some other everyday object you would never have purpose to use.  Then see what happens.  

Chances are FB is either doing this or buying the info from another org like Google, but that's no excuse for a badly made ""proof"" video."

richardeid,1509316200.0,2,"Are the any debuggers for Android or jailbroken iPhones? Or maybe one of those DLL deconstructors? Seems like it'd be pretty easy to see what the app is doing with a program like this.

Also I remember years back (think Gingerbread, 2.3) Facebook was using a method to update their app outside of the Play Store (then Market) until Google disallowed that behavior. I feel like maybe this was some sort of exploit. Or not. I really have no idea. But who's to say FB isn't using some undisclosed OS exploits to gain access to mics where in the OS might not know the app was using the mic, even on devices that have disabled mic access? Tinfoil hatting, for sure. But how would we ever know?

MinneapolisWisconsin,1509318268.0,2," I think it’s important to note that the person who gets your data via microphone analysis doesn’t need to get it FROM Facebook in order to advertise to you on Facebook.   I work in this industry, here’s how it works:

- A shady app, (let’s say it’s a crappy solitaire app), enables microphone listening in the background.  They record you and sell that audio data and your device ID to a shady data aggregator.

- That shady aggregator analyzes the audio and places your device ID into multiple categories and groups device IDs together using other data input too.  For example, they could create a “Cat Owners” data set of device IDs by buying multiple sources and types of data (microphone data from shady apps, form fill-out data from shady sites, search history from more legitimate apps like Target and Walmart).  

- The shady aggregator then sells it to a data aggregator with a solid reputation and one who follows the laws(BlueKai, Oracle, Etc.).  The shady aggregator hides the source of the data they sell by saying their collection methods are “proprietary”.  

- The new owner of this data then aggregates it with even more lists of similar device IDs and then places it up for sale to advertisers all over the world.

- Advertisers then buy a list of device IDs, input the IDs into their own data platforms and export them to Facebook using Facebook’s My Audiences tools.

- The Facebook Audience tool was meant to allow advertisers to advertise to their CURRENT customers(aka 1st Party Data), but clearly advertisers have found a way to use what we call 3rd Party Data on Facebook with data that can’t be traced to its original shady source.

- Facebook is not the culprit here, but they are such a large platform that advertisers are able to find the highest % of device IDs on their list using Facebook. 

TLDR: Facebook has such a high market share of the population, so they are he easiest platform to advertise to people inside of purchased data sets, which is why it is assumed Facebook is the one collecting the data.  However, it’s actually other shady apps collecting the microphone data.  Facebook does collect data, but not via a microphone.

Elvixlyte,1509318465.0,2,"While horrifying, it isn’t as truly bad as it could be.

Additionally, I thought it was common knowledge that Facebook is part of the PRISM program, and what that implies and entails. Maybe that knowledge isn’t as common as I thought?"

Don't get me wrong, doing stuff like this without a user's consent should (and probably is) be illegal, but the actual concept is awesome. I hate ads and install ad block/etc. because most of the ads I see are completely irrelevant to what I'm doing. But if I started to see advertisements for x% off a game on Steam or a new 3D modeling program while I'm browsing the web, that's awesome. That means I'm seeing ads that are useful and intriguing to me, and at the same time support a service I'm using (That's most likely free). I think a lot of people don't understand that free services aren't really free, and that one way or another, we're going to pay for free stuff like Facebook or Google. I'm not supporting a practice like the one shown in the video, especially if the user doesn't explicitly allow Facebook to use the microphone, stuff like that SHOULD be illegal. However, if I could regularly browse the internet and find ads relevant to what I actually like to buy, that'd be awesome for both me and the service I'm using."

I think I was more impressed that what we were talking about actually existed. But yea...... deleted Facebook soon after that on my phone.

After that I did not use my phone. I couldn’t search for anything related to Brighton because I was driving in the car, nor have I looked it up earlier, because it just kinda came up in a conversation what city we could visit besides London.

justinbeatdown,1509328305.0,2,"This has happened to me countless times. I used to work in kitchens, and we would talk a lot about different subjects throughout our shift, as well as just different kitchen jargon. The day it really really threw me off was when it brought up advertisements relating to clam shells. The reason this was so apparent to me is because at my old kitchen, we used to call out take home boxes “clam shells” and throughout our shifts, we’d be yelling “can I get a clam shell to pantry please” or something along those lines.

I never ever said clam shell outside of work, never typed it into my phone or search engines, nothing like that. The only time I ever used to term was when I was on the line."
moschles,1509328339.0,2,"For the naysayers in this thread, I own an android phone, (a type of Moto-X)    sometimes conversations get loud and you say something  like 

+ ""So I googled it, and then it came up with thousands of hits""

+ ""If you don't believe me, you can google Seth Rich"" 

The phone is nowhere near my body, but is nearby in the room on a desk or table.  When I go over to it, it has opened up the listening app automatically.   The reason is because it picked up the word ""googled""   or ""google"" , and then opened the listener from afar.   

Why does this matter? It means the phone is listening to you talk  all the time.  It is waiting for a keyword to open up the voice-automated web search.  In my case the keyword is likely ""google""  or anything that sounds remotely close to that, like ""googled"".  

For anyone in this thread who claims facebook listening to your conversations is somehow **technologically infeasible**, they are just plain wrong.   

Some would say there is no way they could store or transmit that much audio data.  **That claim is idiotic.**  The phone need not transmit the entire audio. merely listen in for  ""cat food""  or ""eyeliner""  or  ""Nvidia""  and then send a tiny packet alerting that such-and-such keyword was spoken near the phone.  Such an identifier would take up less than 4 bytes. (roughly 1000 times less data than thumbnail picture on a sidebar ad).

Within 48 hours I had ads blasted all over my Gmail, my Facebook and anything else I was using that would normally display ads, about mother fucking cookies; chocolate cookie dough, chocolate macadamia nut cookies, do-it-yourself cookie making, Toll House chocolate chips, just all sorts of pieces of things you would need to make some cookies.

It then asked me if I wanted to make a post with those photos, showing the actual photos on my page. I can't even imagine if they were private photos that I did NOT want uploaded anywhere, ever.

**I had not even ever logged into the facebook app.** I ran it and forgot my password so I just exited the app and figured I would check or reset my password later. It figured out who I was from stealing my information from my phone directly (probably through phone numbers I had, or possibly through google apps, or other means). 

So, to go back over it again, it not only stole my personal photos right off my phone while the app was not running, it did so while I had never logged in, also stealing my other personal information from the phone, and figured out who I was using that stolen information to serve me my photos back. I never even saw ads and I have seen enough.

That's one step away from a computer virus or worm. If it replicated itself it absolutely would be.

In most US states, directly recording someone’s voice without their consent is illegal. However, Facebook can process all our conversations via speech-to-text technology, which is trivial these days. 

This serves the dual purpose of greatly reducing storage space for the data (raw audio takes up way more space than text) and avoiding the recording law. Also, parsing/analyzing text is much easier than for audio.

Nexious,1509334201.0,2,"I'm late to this thread and haven't read any comments, but what is demonstrated in the video is **not technically possible on iOS** given their local app sandbox environment and permission requirements. 

This is the kind of video that begins spreading like fire on Facebook and IMs alongside forwards-from-grandma like ""*every time you like this Facebook donates $0.25 to save this girl*"" and ""*by pasting this you will not have to pay for Facebook when they begin charging.*""

**The iOS Facebook app only includes the following permissions, which the user must grant on first launch:**

* **Send You Notifications** - Alerts, Sounds and Icon Badges. This is optional and only required to display alerts across your device when you receive a Facebook notification.

* **Access Your Photos** - This is optional and only required if you click on Photos to upload existing images from your device or take new ones.

* **Find and Connect with Nearby Places, Friends and More** - This is optional and only applicable if you click **Check In** when making a post, in which it offers to display the closest locations as a convenience. 

* **Access Your Location While You are Using the App** - Another optional permission that only asks when you first try posting an update relating to your location (e.g, check in).


That is it. The keyboard uses native iOS which includes speech-to-text capabilities but has no direct interface with Facebook. The Facebook app does not utilize the microphone at all.

When the Facebook app is not in focus, it does nothing but occasionally data fetch to check for new notifications (which can also be disabled from Settings > Facebook).

* **Access the Microphone** - Optional for making voice and video calls and creating voice messages.

If anything it'd be the Messenger app this guy should be interested in, not the Facebook app. Again, short of using private APIs that only Apple native apps utilize (and which would be automatically rejected before hitting the app store), or some of the VOIP APIs for call-related utilities like Skype, Facebook is not doing anything with your microphone especially when you don't have the app open or in focus.

---

To add, the Facebook Settings includes an option ""**Search & Siri Suggestions**"" which, if enabled, allows *Siri* to use Facebook data to improve and expand its results. ""**Siri may learn from and make suggestions based on how you use this app.**"" This is a Siri-related feature and Apple is the one gleaning information from Facebook if you allow it, not vice versa."
ZapSquadie,1509334220.0,2,"On vacation in Hawaii, my brother in law and I were joking around. He said I looked like a tiki doll, we laughed and I said something like “Remember there was a football player named Tiki?”

That afternoon on Facebook I saw an ad captioned “Tiki Barber goes to a Barber”.

That was too obvious because he’s sort of an obscure football player and somehow he’s in an ad all of a sudden just coincidentally after we were talking about tikis?"

my_pen_name_is,1509334728.0,2,"I experienced this the other day with instagram. 

Earlier that day I had bought some perfume for my fiancé, just prior to finishing my purchase I was handed two sample men's colognes. YSL Y and the other I can't remember. I had never heard of the Y scent before but like other YSL colognes so later that night tested it out. Literally the *only* time I  *even* said ""YSL Y"" that day is when my fiancé asked what the scent was; I didn't search it or any other cologne for that matter, didn't even spend much time on my phone period that night, but sure as shit there was an ad for YSL Y in my ig feed the next day. 

I don't think this is just fb, I think it's the phone in general and that is truly terrifying and I think everyone needs to be more concerned about this. Today it's something as innocuous as marketing ploys, but it's only a matter of time before their reach goes further. "
carters_here,1509335097.0,2,"I suspect that my comment won't be the most popular in the thread but why *wouldn't* companies like fb, reddit and Instagram do this? After all, it is their business model, is it not? Are we all truly shocked that this happens? Also, please note that I'm not trying to be argumentative but this is the future of advertising..

After all,let's say you watch a particular show on television or have a favorite radio station. These companies spend millions on market research to best discover who the trarget viewer or listener is for this programming and, in then, in turn sell it to potential clients who can then effectively reach their most likely customers.

For example, a radio station targeting Men, 18 to 34, is going to actively pursue clients that are potential customers that might buy their product, as opposed to Women, 35 to 54, years old. Thus, why you don't hear ads for strip clubs on these female targeted stations. Also, this is why football games predominantly feature ads most likely to target men.

This is also why you'll hear a different McDonald's ad on a station whose programming targets black listeners as opposed to busy working, white Moms on, say, a Country radio station. Advertising has *always* been focused on reaching the most likely potential clients. If you don't want to see ads for cat food, it seems to me that misleading the platform to indicate that you *do*, doesn't really prove a point.

I mean no disrespect to your experiment. Perhaps I'm missing the point.

Personally,I guess this just doesn't bother me? It seems a natural evolution in the world of advertising. Just don't click on the ads. If the ads aren't working and they're not selling any cat food, believe me, the advertiser will call out a flaw in the FB methodology and quit buying ads."

Not the tin foil hat type, but it's been blatant enough that I just took it as a given, this video only confirms my own experiences.

All they need is the ability to detect certain keywords, i.e product/service names and word categories. If I say ""I want to go on an adventure"" then I should expect to see vacation ads.

I thought nothing more of it, didnt search anything, didnt talk about it, nothing. 2 days later i have an ad on facebook advertising a new antique shop in dublin called none other than ""the velveteen rabbit"". Completely freaked me out. But i thought about maybe it was picking up details via GPS. That it knew i had been on a house tour in that location, it auto searched details of that location, as part of those details there was something written online about the people that used to live in the house, more specifically that they wrote a book and the name of said book. The name was auto cross referenced and the name of the shop popped up as an ad that might suit me. This all sounds very far fetched though.

desertravenwy,1509317033.0,4,"I have a feeling this, and many of the anecdotes in this thread, are confirmation bias.

How many ads do you see that have nothing to do with whatever you've been talking about the last few days and you just ignore?  Then you see one and think ""oh shit! I was just talking about that the other day"" and you think it's because facebook is listening.  Yet it's ""the next day"" or in this guy's video, two days later.

If facebook really is listening and serving up ads to you based on what you're talking about all day with your wife, giving you an ad for that thing two days later is kind of a poor way to go about it.  If you're saying you need cat food over and over - you're probably going to go get it that day... Giving you an ad two days later isn't going to convince you to buy that brand - a bag of catfood lasts weeks or months.  One of the other anecdotes in this thread was about air filters - those last months or years.

I see ads for all sorts of things that I dismiss.  If I'm telling someone I need product x, and then I see an ad for product x, that would be great.  Instead, I randomly get a mattress ad or a pizza ad... and then I end up buying pizza.  I can't afford a new mattress."

The next day they become friends with three new people one of which volunteers as a foster home for cats and who is a member of a can rescue facebook group.  Another is a owner of three cats and always searches for cat products.

Then they start searching for hotels for an upcoming trip, and the dates they book just happen to align with a feline convention in that same city.

Boom.  Cat ads in your facebook feed even though all of these things were merely a coincidence.  This is probably why I continue to receive targeted ads for mattresses from half a dozen brands even though I haven't been in the market for a new mattress for years and have no intention of purchasing a new bed anytime soon... yet the ads keep coming.

Sometimes the easiest answer isn't the correct one.  It takes more than simple conjecture to convince me when so many alternatives are much more likely."

Anyways, a couple days later after we had out first DnD session I swear i saw multiple ads on facebook advertising DnD.

1337_roy_jenkins,1509323583.0,2,"This is a shit post because:

1. The video makers could follow cat pages or demonstrated they like cats on any number of facebook properties or facebook partner properties -- which is how FB categorizes their users into ad targeting segments. Showing a cat food ad isn't really an extraordinary stretch because cat food advertisers would just target ""people who show interests in cats"". This has nothing to do with audio ""spying"".

2. They could have taken the picture of the cat ad before filming ""talking about cats"". We're suppose to just believe them? I mean, what possibly could they gain from trying to make a video go viral, besides making ad revenue and driving traffic to their sites \s?

I stopped using it 6 years ago and in all that time there has not been a single instance where I miss it or felt like I missed out on something by not being on it. The more and more that comes out about the company and how they use your information makes me question how so many can support it.

Sure as shit, it had listed the search I was talking about. 
Promptly showed it to my friends in the room and everyone went quiet. What i searched for was merely ""Olive Garden"" related, but it didnt just say Olive Garden, it actually said specifically what I searched for. 
I noped out and told google I had no fucking idea what it was talking about and they promptly gave me my 18 cents and the survay was over.

Also, the fb app was around 110 MB when freshly installed but over time the space it took up increased to 1 GB. If all my data is stored on a server then how can it take up more space on my phone? Are fb using everyones devices as caches? That marked the end of my fb journey. "
cspruce89,1509313805.0,1,"So this is, of course, anecdotal, buuuut...

About 9 years ago, when I was in college, I had made a fake Facebook account to see what all the fuss about Farmville was about.  You see, I didn't want any of my acquaintances to know that I was playing this game so an alt was absolutely necessary.

I created a profile with a fake name, DOB etc.  Even the profile pic wasnt me, it was a picture of a clown that Gizmodo had been using for their Conficker stories.

The game ended up being just as garbage as I thought it would be, but that's not the story.  You see, even with all of this false information, and being located on a major State University with 30,000+ students in my immediate vicinity, Facebook began suggesting friends.  These friends were all people that I knew from my first year in college and other people from my high school.

We should really be asking advertisers if they are buying lists like this, and try clicking the ""why am I seeing this ad?"" links for more clues. This is also the type of behavior that would get your app banned from the app store. "

In fact, this is their whole business model, you are the product and this is why you never paid to use Facebook.

I never install the Facebook app on my phones because I know I'll be tracked like a monkey. 

I know they already track me but to a lesser extent. This really bugs them because for them I'm a less profitable user since I give them less of my personal data.

I'm on facebook since 2007 and used the web chat feature for years and it always worked decently well.. Until they released their native phone app.

Then they started pushing users to the native app. The webchat became increasingly buggy, to the point where now it is literally unusable unless you request the desktop version of the site.

Now on the mobile site if you click the chat icon, you're just asked to install the facebook app.

You want me to believe that a multi-billions dollar web company cannot ship a web chat application that just works? Not a chance.

They market it as a better user experience, but it's not really for the user. It's a better experience for them because native apps can have access to your microphone, camera, position and all other sensors of your phone.

Now you really think they will ask permission to all those data sources and not use it?

Don't kid yourself and start paying attention to what phone apps are asking access for.

I don't install my banking institution's own application because their app is asking permission to access **literally everthing**.

Why should I give them access to my microphone, camera, contacts, calls, address book, GPS and all that just to check my account balance and pay invoices?

Remember that huge wave of anti-fracking videos that showed people lighting their water on fire? Those were shown to be faked or people contaminated their own wells in most of the cases.

For example, this is why I was shown a Land Rover ad:

>Why Am I Seeing This Ad?

>One reason you're seeing this ad is that Land Rover wants to reach people interested in Outdoor recreation, based on activity such as liking Pages or clicking on ads.

All these stories about using words and then seeing related ads pop up: those are just anecdotes, and they're a PERFECT example of Confirmation Bias. Ever hear any stories about having a conversation about something and then NOT seeing ads for it pop up on facebook? Nope, I didn't think so. So you have a situation where any instance of creepy facebook behavior gets remembered and shared, and all the billions of times there was no creepy facebook behavior get forgotten. The plural of anecdote is NOT data!

Even if you start talking about cat food and then seeing ads about cat food, it could still just be a coincidence! With what, like a billion people on facebook, the odds of such a coincidence happening to somebody are really high. You'd have to have a bunch of people start talking about cat food and a bunch of people not, and then you could maybe start being able to see if talking about cat food increased your odds of getting cat food ads."

I do have a wallet and never searched for one. In the next few days Facebook was advertising two different wallet/money clip offers to me and I thought it was very bizarre.

kj4ezj,1509314880.0,1,"I read The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. He talks about Target's scale of user tracking and their efforts to send consumers (paper) ads for exactly what they need when they need it. Target soon realized that they were creeping everyone out because the advertisements were so spot-on. In order to stop scaring their customers they had to start sending ads that they knew were completely wrong for the consumer in addition to the correct ones. They would print one flyer with all the ads for a small group of adjacent houses so the consumers didn't feel like they were being targeted directly, and it appears to be a coincidence that what they need is on page 3."

Facebook never asked for the audio permission (i think they specify it in the manifest only in case you want to record audio for a wall post).

3. Could an employee or former employee from FB or Google dare to comment off the record? They are probably prevented to do so by strict NDA...But at the same time there are now whistleblower protection laws...and a platform like Wikileaks so they can share things safely.

I have never had ANY interest in law school. I have never googled it or even spoken aloud about wanting a law degree or anything (I have a bachelor of music degree). One day, a mere thought popped into my mind -- studying law for a few moments seemed exciting and promising. Realizing that I wasn't really interested, I brushed it off as a short-lived fantasy. While having these thoughts, I was alone and did not speak to anyone about it. I didn't verbalize it in any way...

Fastforward a couple of days later and I have ads on Facebook for taking the *LSAT*.

I was absolutely gobsmacked. There's no reason I could think that that ad would be targeted toward me, and I still can't think of a reason. 

Coincidence? Maybe and probably. Still freaks me out when I think about it."
Terrariant,1509315196.0,1,So I don't think it's Facebook that's listening. It's probably your phone itself that listens to keywords you need and sends that information to the apps that you use.

I met her when she was having some issues, and we don't have any sexual attraction or anything. We basically just talk, since she comes from a situation that isolates herself a lot. One day , she was complaining about bras, that some have this plastic thing going on, and with some bras she gets bruised and doesn't know who to talk about this. I commented to her that some women I know wear sports bras even  when they are not playing sports as they are comfortable and don't have this problem with the frame, since they don't have a frame at all. We talked about it for a while (in person, not online, I didn't do any searches, I was going by personal experience as I dated a couple of girls who did this). Well guess what, next day all ads on my facebook feed were about lingerie , sports bras, and presents for ""my special lady"" , so she'd know that she mattered to me. That freaked me the fuck out, and it's the reason why I removed facebook everywhere from my life. Even my amazon suggested items were about sports bras. And the worst is people that really don't understand that you don't have a facebook account, and whenever I explain this story they either think I'm a paranoid lunatic or that I actually searched for this etc. I never did, I never searched about it as I'm a single male without a relationship, so I don't look for this or talk about this with anyone since I have no use for bras obviously. This targeted ad lasted for a  whole week. I never got bra's or women garment suggestions, chocolate boxes, make up bundles, until that day.

POST-EDIT: Forgot to add, she got these ads as well, but no ""for your special lady"". They were mostly discounts on sportswear, which is odd since she doens't play any sports due to circumstances."

I had a phone conversation with my doctor to make an appointment for echocardiogram for the next day. It was a brief conversation around 2 minutes.

During the hour long bus ride over to the echocadiologist's office I was listening to Pandora radio. I had 3 ads for radiocardiologists. I was creeped out. I've never heard an ad for echocardiograms on Pandora ever and didn't know what one was until I asked my doctor what it was on the phone. I've never searched it in my life either. 

There is only two explainations. Total coincidence or that I was being targted with this ad by Pandora. If it were the latter it would would be two explainations.

The doctor's office sells my health records to ad agencies. Which is against the law? Hipaa compliance? 

My conversation was being recorded as a text file and being sold to ad agencies.

I don't think an echocardiologist would waste money with an ad campaign targeting money because it is such a specific need unlike cat food or baby diapers. It just doesn't add up. Pun intended.

I keep seeing anecdotal evidence but does anyone have any packet testing? Like a Wireshark test or something on the app? I've yet to see ACTUAL data besides videos like this.

I'm not by any stretch saying it's impossible, but I'm lost on how they would do it. 

Look at it this way: 

Lets say the mic is always on. On so now your looking at 2 options. 

1. The data is being processed locally on the phone. Ok well processing that data real time 24/7 on your phone would be a hell on your processor, thus causing people en masse to not use the app rendering it useless. FB app IS known for draining battery I agree, but not at that level. 

2. The voice data is being sent by packet stream to a server. Now it get a little more outlandish. If you look at VOIP packet data which would work the same then you're looking at 200kb-1.5mb per minute data rate 24/7. Ok well thet would be caught lickity split by millions... Or again by a simple packet test... Which I have yet to see any data on. 

So you could say ""Well that's how OK google and Siri work"". And you'd be right... Kinda. The packets ARE processed server side BUT only after it hits a certain pre-trained activation frequency which you have personally calibrated. FB does implement a 'feature' to detect commercials in the background but that works the same way as the Siri and OK Google frequency activation. 

For now if your worried about it go to settings and turn the mic off for the app. It cannot bypass the API. But until I get some packet tracking numbers I'm going to file all this under anecdotal. "

My brother is a huge redneck in Maryland and I am a filmmaker in LA. We could not be more different. When we were together at Christmas last year, he told me all about this cool gadget our Uncle gave him. Its one of those night vision cameras that go off when an animal crosses its path. You put it on a tree or something similar to see activity on a property for hunting or security purposes. This was the first time in my life I learned about or even talked about this device. A few hours later, I had ads all over my Facebook for the same exact night vision camera my brother had. 

Its super creepy, but as a young twenty something, I feel like I can't delete the app because I use Facebook daily to keep track of invites and find gigs as a freelance filmmaker.  Its incredibly frustrating. "

The ads have been for things that I've personally searched amazon for within the last day or two. Stuff she hasn't searched for from her device or account and doesn't even know what they are. We do share an Amazon prime account, but each with our own amazon login, etc. It seemed to me that the ads she was seeing were based on some link between our amazon accounts and then Facebook latched onto as advertising against her Amazon stuff after it had pulled from mine through the prime link (whatever that is and however that works). Not sure, but it's freaky what it's advertising for and how it could know.

Makes me wonder if instead of listening it's sort of tracking who you communicate with and what THEY search too, maybe without you even knowing that the other person did some searches. And then that search history works it's way back to you and your ads. I dunno, maybe far fetched but seems to me to be what happened to us. Unless it really was listening, because some of the ads we had also discussed in view of the phones and likely while her Facebook app was open (while I was searching on my phone)."

Testing of this really needs to be in a controlled setting with Siri not enabled etc to truly see if it's just Facebook that's listening. With Siri integrated so much into the iOS now, there could be some overlap.

To do a more relevant experiment, you'd have to start talking about some random shit that you normally have no interest in (without googling for info about it).

For example, I can target my ads to anyone who has a family member's anniversary coming up. I can target my ads to friends of people with an interest.

So if your friend just bought something, or just searched something, and you are closely associated with them on FB - it might then bucket you into an ad category due to THEIR internet habits and interest. Again, doesn't explain all of this but it can explain a lot."

AxeOfWyndham,1509316883.0,1,"Eavesdropping aside, for years I've considered facebook one of the most sinister entities on the planet. I can't wait until they finally get nailed and go the way of AOL and MySpace. It WILL happen, they operate under public trust and they have a lot of skeletons they've been jamming into the closet.

So many of the things they do are destructive to social cohesion. I left facebook a year ago, and as I understand there is still no dislike button. You get a Hobson Choice between a like or non like, and the only way to disagree is to leave a comment. It creates a facade of more positive feedback than content actually deserves. It fosters sycophancy, and undeniably has kindled a lot of the issues with radicalism we have to deal with today. 

When morally self-important people post to facebook, people whom you likely disagree with be they psycho feminists or insane Christian fundamentalists, you either reply and identify yourself to their ideological scorn, or you sit quiet. Agreement is just an anonymous button click, but they offer no protection or simple mechanism for the disagreement necessary in a healthy society.

Still, eavesdropping, if it's true, would be an even more egregious and urgent justification for the end of facebook."

* instagram
* WhatsApp
* pages manager 
* mentions
* boomerang

[Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) is a real thing. You could pass 10 red BMW's in two days and not notice or even remember you saw them. Then after seeing your friend bought a red BMW you suddenly start seeing them everywhere. Had OP seen that ad for cat food without having done this little ""experiment"" he would not have thought anything about it and likely wouldn't even remember seeing it even though he did.

Again to be clear, I'm not saying it's not true. I'm simply saying this isn't enough evidence for me to be convinced it is 100% true. I'm just skeptical of this claim. Without being able to see code or sniff web traffic the only other way to truly verify this would be to perform an actual scientific study and track results on a larger scale. If there's a signal there it should be easy to spot in data gathered from a proper study."

The only way around it is to pay for applications, so they have a source of revenue, otherwise they'll sell your data because they have to make money somehow. Obviously FB is an exception, but in general a ton of apps do it and it's frustrating, but we have to do something about as consumers. It's similar to the trend in the gaming industry with free stuff + loot crates+ in game buy ins. People hate paying for games, the average cost of a higher end mobile game can be $1M, but if they charge $2.99 or something no one buys it. So instead they introduce in game shit and the few people who go nuts and spend $100 or whatever subsidize the rest of us. Consumers have to make a choice in both cases.

The first is cookies that track your browsing experience any time you arrive then leave Facebook. You don't need to go to a cat food website or search catfood to get those ads. You can be going to a website to look at cat videos or you happened to look at one cat video then the Facebook Ad targets you. 

The second thing is that they could just be pushing out a random ad and they so happened to get that ad. Now if they do have a powerful relevant ad serving system, this might be a fluke.

shane_jayc,1509318169.0,1,"holy fuck, I just realized something. I do not speak Spanish. I can understand it kind of, but it is not a language i or anybody close to me uses. But about a year ago i move to Miami where lots of people speak Spanish. Now I do not use Facebook. But I am on YouTube a lot. One of my close coworkers doesn't speak much English, so she only talks to me in Spanish. And for whatever reason, a good majority of my YouTube ads were in Spanish. Now I guess it could be a location setting, which might make more sense, but previously I lived near a large Hispanic demographic, but was not in direct conversation with them. And I also never noticed and other geographical specific ads. so idk"

Poopandawater,1509318250.0,1,"I know the company that designed this type of advertising and it is very real. At a company summit in September this was a topic of discussion.

There is a video that came out a year or two ago showing a person in a bus living in basically an augmented reality world, shopping and ads come up in mid air etc... when I'd first seen tha video I kinda laughed like ""lol that would be crazy"" but again at the summit they talked about basically that very idea and how technology to make it happen isn't far away and is being implemented into smartphone apps that users agree to download. I wish I could say what company it is but I don't know what kind of disclosure shit I'd be breaking, however I don't recall signing any anti disclosure shit ever.

sam1amm,1509318254.0,1,"I used to work in NYC and my particular floor within the building I worked in was one of those floors that had several different businesses that shared one big office on a whole floor, where each company essentially leased out a room from the company who owned the floor, and then shared the rest of the floor’s amenities (meeting rooms, coffee/kitchen, bathroom, etc). 

One day, me and my co-workers were eating lunch in the kitchen area and ran into a few of the employees from one of the other businesses on the floor.  They were around our ages (mid 20’s-low 30’s) so they sat with us to eat lunch. 

When we asked what they did, they told us they created ‘a program that sorts through massive amounts of data from facebook and a few other sources and targets certain keywords from people’s accounts and groups those accounts’.  They then sell the grouped account to their clients based on the keyword/s. 

We were really interested, so we asked more questions. I’ll never forget their answers because we were so blown away that we started testing this ourselves and even looked into using them for our own advertising.  We asked about the ‘keywords’ and this is where it got interesting:

“Anytime you use facebook, or Instagram, or a smart TV, or even just have your smart phone turned on, it is collecting both user data as well as passive data such as voice data from your mic in your phone, to location data, or even visual data from your camera. Everyone has so much data linked to a certain ID within your device. Certain companies like Samsung, VERIZON** (personal ‘holy shit’ moment), and Facebook- are especially good at collecting this data. We get hired by companies who are trying to sell a certain product, and we match their product to targeted individuals who are expressing interest in that product IN CLOSE TO REAL TIME.”  Wtf??

“Yeah like if you talk about wanting hot dogs, that keyword is saved on your account. If you talk about something a few different times, and then we detect you walked into a supermarket, we can instantly put ads about hot dogs onto any app that uses advertising ID’s which you will see if you use any of those apps while you’re in the store. It’s pretty much useless unless we get to it quick. That’s why companies pay us the big bucks”. 

Me and my co-workers spent the next week playing around with this.  My boss went absolutely nuts when he got an ad on facebook for Michael’s (that arts and crafts store) the day after his wife was telling him that their daughter needed stuff like sparkles, glue, and poster board for a school project. This is when we all accepted this new fact of life and decided we might as well use it for our own benefit instead of be freaked out. But dam, it’s some freaky stuff. I forget the name of the company, I don’t work in that office anymore (no, not because of that company. Those guys were cool). 

To this day, I wish I had asked them how they get access to the data. This is the real mystery to me...you guys best believe our smart technology is listening to everything we say, this is no conspiracy. You can turn this ‘advertising ID’ off somehow supposedly, but I am not sure how ‘off’ it really would be. Who knows. "

GorllaDetective,1509318339.0,1,"I doubt there is any point in posting this as it will most likely gets buried but in my opinion as some one who works in the online industry at a very large social media company who is a direct competitor to Facebook...they are not listening to your microphones and targeting you based on what you say. I live and breathe online advertising every day and work with people who are now employed at Facebook and with people who were previously at Facebook. As part of my job I need to understand there competitive offering and how there systems work. This is not something they are doing. They would also never jeopardize their largest revenue stream with such blatant actions and violating their own privacy and end user agreements. They understand that their revenue comes fr their users and would not risk their user base over something like this.

As for the video posted...from what was displayed that was a terrible example of scientific method and a general understanding of how online advertising actually works. There are a ton of reasons that I could suggest that are way more possible for why they may see that ad other than “Facebook is spying on our conversations!” :

1. At some point someone in your household did in fact search for cats or cat food either on Facebook or elsewhere. Could of been days ago, weeks ago, possibly even months ago, doesn’t matter still counts. Tracking cookies can last for months

2. You like a lot of cat videos or posts on Facebook. Facebook will track this activity and may infer that you own a cat, whether you do or not. They then purposefully target the ad to you.

3. Pure coincidence...if you could repeat this same experiment with a brand new phone that has never searched for something at a location where you have also never searched for something, ensuring a brand new install of the Facebook app with a brand new account that has never been used AND THEN consistently repeat the behavior you are claiming and document it all well and properly that would prove something.

Otherwise you are just conflating correlation with causation.

They are not listening to your phone calls with out your permission and targeting you with ads based on your conversations. Most people out there have a very poor understanding of how online media is actually served and that is what I am choking this recent surge of ton foil hatism to.

I am happy to answer questions should anyone have any on how online ad serving actually works to help demystify the process."

I don't write in Spanish or search for things in Spanish on my phone.  SO never uses my phone to speak to her family, and never uses it to search anything.

With that established, I get ads in Spanish.  It usually happens after her family comes over but it also happens at other random times.  It isn't just Facebook either, it's also Google AdChoices too and probably others.

These processes are probably automated.  I'm not a Spanish speaker and targeting me with those ads is a failure from a marketing perspective.  I do make sure that my phone is in the other room unless I'm actively using it or am expecting a call/text.

teapot5,1509318631.0,1,"I told people about this and thought it was a bit farfetched but I did exactly the same thing with my girlfriend. 

I had been noticing ads associated with things I was doing. At the start of the year I wanted to buy a PS4; low and behold I had PS4 ads. I'm a bit lazy so I hadn't actually been looking online, just waiting for my friend who worked at an electronics store to tell me when he could get a good deal. So I hadn't been searching online at all, and it was really just discussion with my friends about it. And I got targeted ads. I remember this one in particular because I really hadn't googled it. This happened with a lot of things; most instances it wasn't that notable because it had been happening a lot and was the odd ad about something I'd mentioned once. 

My girlfriend noticed too; so we decided to try it out. We started talking about Vodafone, a cellphone company here. Neither of us use the network, and even if we did it's not something you mention. And then later on we BOTH got Vodafone ads. We decided to use that because it's something we legitimately never interact with. To be fair it may have been chance, but given that we had both experienced what seemed like targeted ads a lot it wasn't likely to be the case. 

I read that it's potentially some apps like Instagram that have access to the microphone (I think facebook itself does too, because you can use camera through the app). They gather keywords and sell that information to advertisers or target ads for you. 

Super fucking dodgy that they don't tell you about this. I wouldn't mind it if they were open about it because obviously targeted ads have their uses. But who knows what they do with that information? "

namep,1509318807.0,1,"I don't even have the Facebook app installed. The first thing I did was remove it (My LG came with it pre-installed). I was chatting with some co-workers about what to do for lunch. I happened to recall going to Ci-Ci's pizza a lot when I was a kid, and the only one I knew of closed years ago. My co-worker mentioned there was one on their side of town and that was the end of the conversation. 

Later in the day, I was talking about an escape room I had visited, which was also on my co-worker's side of town. They were talking about trying to do one with their family, so I went to look it up, and what do I see on the Google maps results for the Escape room? You guessed it. The Ci-Ci's pizza from our earlier conversation. 

Again, I don't have facebook installed, and this happened using the built in Google Maps app, so the only thing I'm left thinking is that my whole phone is one big bug for advertising companies. The kicker is half of the time when I make a call, neither person can hear each other. Take that how you will.

TL;DR: Co-worker mentioned a presumed long-closed pizza place. Searched for an Escape Room and Google Maps marked a still open store of that pizza place in the results too. Don't even have the FB app installed."
Bongserpent,1509318811.0,1,"I don't mean to be ""that guy"", but this feels to me like a 'no shit' moment. Facebook is essentially free for this reason. It's probably in the terms and conditions somewhere that we give them consent to do this. Facebook is just a data farm for advertisers. We are the crops.

Amazon does the same thing. If I say enough keywords out loud, my Amazon ads on the computer (same Google account on phone and PC) will reflect what I mentioned around my phone. I know Amazon isn't with Google, but all these huge companies must be in cahoots with each other on this deal.

Just uninstall the apps if you aren't comfortable with it. It creeped me out initially, but I rationalized that it's probably not saved anywhere after being processed by whatever algorithm they use. I can also just turn off my phone's wifi. Can't send data if there's no signal."

Cody610,1509318874.0,1,"I noticed the same issue a few months back and took the app off my phone. I kept it on my tablet and it continued to happen until I uninstalled. If you search the Android sub you find people *[without Facebook]* claiming Google themselves has been listening in on mics for purpose of ads. I saw them as early as late 2015. I uninstalled the Facebook app on my phone long ago when they required Facebook Messenger, then I had to stop using the mobile browser version because that also started to require Messenger.

On the rare occasion I use Facebook now I use the 3G version, the Facebook Lite application. It's an official Facebook app intended for people in other countries that only have 3G connections. So it's basically the old Facebook app, allows you to check and reply to messages without messenger. 

**UNFORTUNATELY,** it isn't available on the US Play Store so you have to find a clean .apk to install. Make sure you check and compare checksums so you know the app hasn't been tampered with and is the version available from the Play Store in other countries. It does work fine with US IP addresses and phone networks. The version I have does not need the long laundry list of permissions the standard app does, including microphone permissions. 

I haven't had the issue since, if I did it happens so little I don't even take notice. Whereas I would notice it numerous times a week happening on my tablet which had Messenger and the standard Facebook application. I wonder why it doesn't happen on the lite version, maybe because people would notice the data fluctuations."

Hadnt looked up anything on my phone at all but all of a sudden I was getting heaps of adds for engagement rings on my phone.

human_trampoline,1509319015.0,1,"Ok this happened to me and I was mystified. I was making some videos for work and needed to get them closed captioned. At my work we have a transcribing service that does this. I only communicated about this over the phone at work with the transcribing office (a landline) and on my work email (super secure institutional email). I never bothered with a google search because I didn’t need to shop around, we have an office that looks after this.

Next day, my Facebook ads were for audio transcription services. A niche service if there ever was one. And I’d never seen ads for it before. I was totally freaked and wondered if somehow the cookies on my browser let Facebook read my secure work email accessed through that browser. 

Now I wonder if they could have been robo listening to my phone call. 

Everyone is dead right to be skeptical that this video PROVES listening in. It doesn’t. But it raises something we need to investigate further with controlled tests, because I sure as hell don’t trust Facebook to tell me if they are doing this.

Bloody_Good_Aussie,1509319467.0,1,"Battery life on smartphones does generally seem to be a bit shot compared to the specs they boast.

I gauge this against iPhone Plus models: 6 plus had amazing battery life (maybe just before they started having the mic listening to us?), 6s was shocking and it was only a 200mah difference with one extra GB of ram. My girlfriend's 7 plus is terrible, it lasts if you're lucky half a day and her usage is high to moderate.

Sometimes I'll forget, or they talk about a product but then change their mind, or I'll talk them out of it etc so I don't ever search for them. The main thing to note is they often order stuff I'd never get myself, or anything close. For example, wrought iron garden furniture, handheld massager for arthritis relief, wind chimes, and magnifying glasses.

I never really used my Facebook except for certain occasions. Now when I started to Google, yes just Google, info on a few cars because I was in the market for one, I noticed car ads popping up on Facebook. When I narrowed down my choices to two different cars and leaning more towards one, I noticed those car ads switched over to the car I was leaning towards. That right there made me unnerved knowing that they can get info like that simply by data mining what you type into Google. So I deleted my account with the reason of ""I don't enjoy being data mined"" and I thought that was going to be the end of it, but wait there's more! So after ""deleting"" my Facebook, I open my phone's browser and boom, a tab was already opened, without my control, for Facebook's terms and agreements. Keep in mind that I close all tabs in my browser when I'm done, so this was not opened by me, but instead by Facebook's UI. Am I the only one who finds it upsetting that not only are they listening to your phone, but also has the power to control other apps essentially? 

TL;DR : Facebook doesn't just listen, it can actually use your phone without your knowledge."

dp421685,1509320642.0,1,"I've worked at big ad agencies and now work on the brand side launching and running digital campaigns. I know how targeting works  and have talked with numerous publishers that use 1st and 3rd party data. Not going to go into too much detail but there are many things at work here. Ad retargeting have many layers to it. One, publishers generally  use IP address to cookie you, so once you connect to someone else's wifi, you will be retargeted with any searches or demo segments that IP has been cookies with. Geo fencing is another way advertisers can cookie you; they may have identified the area you are in as a high intent demo or their target audience for whatever they are pushing. Credit Card data is huge as well as targeting is formed from your financial data and demo, I.e. HHI, address, purchase history, etc. I can't definitively say what is at work here but these are some ways retargeting works. 

The bigger take away is that targeting is much more sophisticated than it was 1-2 years ago and there is so much more data on the individual so I am not that surprised the ads are highly relevant. The only way publishers get huge ad budgets from advertisers is to prove they have very precise targeting. "

The absolute biggest problem tho(IMHO) is the effect it's having on our democracy. Fake headlines pushes by some teenage kid in Morocco trying to make some quick cash get liked and shared thousands(or 100s of thousands) of times and if you don't think that had an effect on our last election then you can just fuck right off

Everything else I've seen from FB pretty much fucking sucks too. Like the guy who created a blank slate account and immediately had his irl friends suggested to him, the listening this video demonstrates, and lastly just the whole deal of us giving up our private info/location and getting practically nothing in return. 


If I didn't have a business page through them tied to my personal profile I would have been gone long ago. The posts today and this video have actually convinced me to go ahead and make my own site for the business and get as far the fuck away from FB as I can.

viksl,1509321734.0,1,"Just curious but it's one facebook profile, so let's say you search for cat food on your computer one day because hey you have a living cat (not a dead one ok) then all other services that have a connection to that searcher and/or site you landed on with/about cat foot has info about you. Let's say facebook's ads (as any other ads service) is connected to these databases. Now, fb nows about your (still alive) cat so it shows you cat food ads once in a while on your compoter screen while you are petting your dear little cat (still kicking) on your lap. Then one day you pick your phone with fb ap installed on. I wonder if that app is somehow connected (internet? wi-fi?) to fb servers which have the cat data on you!

Perhaps even more elaborate algorithm is in action here. It might cycle different ads depending on your inputs from your entire life span on fb and times of searching the web in some way.

I'd like to see more tests, for example pick a fresh profile with no friends, on the necessary info for registration and only done through a clean new cell phone from an ip in a middle of woods, talk days about cat food into it, keep it recording 24/7 and show the ads. Then repeat this several times with different keywords on the same device. Paralely with multiple devices, multiple wi-fi centers in a middle of nowhere.

Not defending fb here just being slightly sarcastic here ;-) - and curious.

PS: What if your friend on a coffee shop's wi-fi searches for cat food and you walk there a day later while he is gone petting his own living cat? :p"

Are there other fb-connected apps running? Can we do it with something more niche than cat food - which over 30% of households need to buy anyway. I mean, I don't have a cat and I get cat food ads sometimes. Ideally, it would be something like rock climbing gear, merch from a children's show, something you'd never in your life think about buying, AND also something that you would have certainly noticed if you'd had ads for before now - like I wonder how many times this guy has scrolled past a cat food ad and not noticed because he doesn't have a cat and he doesn't want to watch an ad."

The only way I can think of my phone knowing this was either

a) My phone was listening in to the movie (I disabled the ""Ok Google"" feature)
or
b) Google pulled data out of my Netflix account and saw I just watched John Wick (I do have the app installed on my phone)

Avenage,1509322306.0,1,"Okay so it's possible that this isn't facebook but the OS itself. 

""Big Data"" companies essentially make their money by buying up and combining things you never even thought of to create a profile for you as a user, they then sell that combined profile on to other companies. 

It's entirely possible that facebook aren't actually listening to you, but apple/google/another app is and are selling that data on. Facebook then updates their ad profile for you after integrating their latest batch of data and then you get your targeted ads. This would also explain why it happens a day or two afterwards.

So just because you see the ads on facebook doesn't mean they're the ones listening, they probably just buy it from google or apple or some other intermediary."

This video could have EASILY been faked aswell to stir up some controversy. Notice how the Ratings are disabled. You don't need to search for things for it to be recommended to you as well.

If it wasn't for that they wouldn't be able to stay in business. All Facebook cares about is money. And no. It is not an invasion of your privacy because you gave them permission to do it. By signing up with Facebook when you click the OK button you are legally agreeing to let them use your personal information for business purposes. So you are telling them, ""Yes you can use my information and sell it to other companies so they can profit off of me."" You have to read the terms of service before you click the OK button on things. If you don't want them to sell your information, then do not use Facebook (or Instagram for that matter because they are owned by Facebook). It is annoying but these are the days we live in. :("

a. Facebook saying they don't listen to you to serve up ads

b. the people saying they get advertised to on Facebook based on what their phone hears


There are millions of advertisers on Facebook that are able to target people based on uploading lists of email addresses to Facebook and matching verse Facebook users' email addresses to target on FB.

It's possible that there's another app you've installed on your phone that is listening, matching, and then selling your data for others to advertise to you on Facebook. Maybe a ""free"" one.

Could be Facebook testing things very quietly (release something to 0.0001%). But with the massive market share and hundreds of millions of active users, I think there'd be a lot more noise about this if it was done at scale.

So my guess is:

a. Facebook testing something with minuscule % of users

b. Another app doing this and selling your data to advertisers who use Facebook (as well as probably other ad networks)"

Odds are good I’ll be writing an offer in the next few days after she gets her finances squared away and current house ready to list.

1-800-BICYCLE,1509323074.0,1,"My theories on this whole thing:

- You’re a lot more predictable than you think you are. Facebook has perhaps made their algorithm *too* good and wandered into an Uncanny Valley of sorts where people feel like they’re no longer acting independently.

- The tracking on content and searches these days is so ubiquitous that collections of related searches and content views can lead an algorithm to “know” what you’re thinking about in advance (this is similar to how the game 20 questions works).

- If microphones are involved at all, chances are they’re more likely to come from Amazon Echo or Google Home. Recording everything on the mic and sending it to a server would be a massive battery drain (not to mention a violation of Apple’s privacy policy).

So they record your keywords, press them onto vinyl, and ship it through freight to the nearest advertiser?

Take how long it took for me to respond to this post with just a soft, human brain. About 6 hours, give or take the few minutes where I saw, clicked, watched, and decided to respond.

RedRevolver98,1509323786.0,1,"If this technology exists: then Facebook isn't the only corporation collecting your information this way. 

We should assume that Apple, Google, samsung, Amazon, and any other tech giant also has this capability and is currently acting this way because they have a motivating reason to do do.

I understand that this is unsettling... I certainly don't want Facebook to recommend porn stars to follow, and I don't want the federal government extending control to divide us in secret or cause anymore distrust inside society so that it can grab more power. 

The question is, do we benefit from more sources collecting our information or less sources? I would think we would want more sources to have more of our information to inflate the value that it brings; and to intentionally provide misleading or false information to create a smoke screen of who you really are if somebody does decide to trade your information: then only you hold the  truth.

https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/facebook-does-not-use-your-phones-microphone-for-ads-or-news-feed-stories/

You could dismiss this is typical corporate lying, and perhaps it is.  However, if they *are* using your microphone for ad targeting & said nothing, legally they would be fine.  There's nothing illegal about it.

However, given they've posted saying they're **not** doing it, if they were, there now be **major** FTC ramifications.

So I'm inclined to believe them.  Silence would have been more indicting.

You’ve willingly, in most cases explicitly and intentionally, given all this data to Facebook.

Who needs to eavesdrop? Conversations are messy and full of dead ends and false leads. But if I know who you are usually with, and how you influence each other, then you don’t even need to have your phones in the room for me to know what you guys talked about. I just need someone to react to the private conversation by doing something online. Hell, give me enough data, and I’ll predict the conversation before it even happens. "

In addition, we've had multiple denials from staff at Facebook that this is happening.

In addition, Apple, who advertises the privacy benefits to the iOS platform, has reviewed every new Facebook submission to the App store and approves updates to the Facebook app to the App Store on a weekly basis.

I'm aware of the blatantly obvious privacy issue, but it's pretty much unavoidable at this point in time. If you look at it from the other direction it makes ad targeting easier and more effective, lowering the cost of placing ads, which in turn will be a benefit for you as the ads are no longer being spammed to reach the same kind of exposure. Ad companies already collect all kinds of other data about you so this should really not come as a shock.

Also, Google might already be doing this with android phones in general for all you know, and if not there's no guarrantee they're not going to do it in the future. "

I don't know if it's the phone, Pandora, Facebook, or some combination of all of them. All I know is I'm fairly confident it's literally listening to conversations for keywords.

a) Facebook friends, so FB may be testing ads on you for a subject your friend searched for guessing that you have common interests. Especially if you message, interact, like each others shit on FB. 
b) Marked as “in a relationship” or married in which case you can assume FB makes the above correlation times 1000. 
c) In the same geolocation, so FB may be testing ads on you people in the same location searched for. 
d) Using the same WiFi network, so FB may be testing ads on you people in the same IP range searched for. 
e) Any combination of the above would only increase your chances of seeing an ad for something they searched for.

Eldritch6601,1509327763.0,1,"There really should be a solid test done. 
Like someone gets a new iPhone and Android, set them up each with a new Facebook account, and leave them in a monitored room. They record all ads that show up when Facebook is first installed; and then proceed to talk about X item for an hour or so. 
They check the ads, and see if they've shifted to that area. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

By using New Phones, New FB accounts, and keeping the phones in an area where it would only be exposed to the conversation intentionally had in front of it; it ensures that there's no potential tainting of evidence. In otherwords, 0 Chance of previous googles, 0 Chance of it reading messages, and 0 chance of it going off of texts or anything from other apps. "

I would guess that there are a ton of other factors that lead to this sort of thing.

uncertain-ithink,1509328040.0,1,"I don't understand how facebook could be doing this. Particularly in a sandboxed environment such as iOS. If an app is using your microphone on iOS, it will have a giant red banner at the top of the screen, saying what app is using your microphone. None of us are seeing this.

Also, I have facebook and facebook messenger installed. I have pretty shit battery life on my phone, but I use pokemon go and snapchat. They are battery hogs.

Facebook and Facebook messenger are never on my battery usage list. I don't think an app I barely use or open (or have background app refresh enabled for) are going to be using my battery in any way, particularly if the system doesn't report those as using power.

I'm just very skeptical of the whole thing. But I must admit, since this school year started, I've gotten a TON of ads, constantly, for Grammarly. I'm taking a College Comp course. Where we constantly are talking about writing essays, etc. Pretty weird.

I'm sure it would be easy to deduce though that I am a student, and just start throwing ads at me for that because of the time of year, with school starting."

RounderKatt,1509328071.0,1,"This isn't proof. There won't be proof either.

Facebook has a MASSIVE  bug bounty program. That is, they pay hackers who find holes in their code and responsibly report them. This means there are thousands of hackers sniffing packets from Facebook app every day. If this were real, one of them would see the data being sent and have reported it everywhere and be presenting it at every hacker convention. 

Hell Android can be decompiled into dalvic, so just grab the app and see for yourself. 

This is a combination of the Bader Meinhoff effect, combined with joint usage of natted IP addresses (i.e. someone you live with searched for it), and good old fashion targeted marketing. There's a famous case where target marketed pregnancy coupons to a teen girl whose enraged parents were adament that she couldn't be pregnant. Turns out target was right.

stantron5k,1509328170.0,1,"Same situation here on the very peculiar delivery of ads after someone nearby a specific device mentioning a unique (and previously unmentioned phrase).

However, I had a super creepy situation occur the other day that is still boggling my mind. I was browsing Twitter (official app on iOS 11). Checked out a sale on some leather laptop bags. Later that day someone and asked me if I was looking at leather bags. My surprised response was along the lines of “uh, yeah... why?” Then the person shows me their feed on Facebook (official app iOS 11) with the specific bags I was looking at.

I had an FB account years ago only populated with fake info. I don’t recall any specific connection to this person and haven’t used it in a long time. I have never had an FB related app installed on the device I was browsing Twitter with. The other person does not have a Twitter account and has never had a Twitter app installed on their device. I have never accessed Twitter on their device, nor have they accessed FB on my device.

My big question: aside from the creepy data leap across users, what about the leap across apps? From Twitter to FB? Are these companies in cahoots sharing user data like crazy as a quid-pro-quo or even worse — for a fee?

I get the scenario of eavesdropping on a user’s device and then serving up targeted ads. I don’t like it, but I get it. The scenario I witnessed of my browsing activity appearing in a completely different app on someone else’s device is just devious.

NO, I WAS NOT LOOKING AT MIDGET, CLOWN, BIG-TOE-FETISH, PORN... Why do you ask!? "

Once working there I talked a lot more about pets in the presence of my phone. THEN BOOM. Tonnes of ads.

I got ads (not just a few) for Destiny 2, after only verbally talking about it, since it is a game my friends wanted, they told me all the ins and outs and I didn't have to search about it even once. Now this wouldn't be that odd if it wasn't for the volume of the ads, I mean it was a lot."

We tested the theory by thinking of something we haven't seen or heard of for years. The subject we decided on was waffles. We live in Australia and it is not a common food here like it is in Australia. We started by occasionally dropping the word waffle into our group chat randomly, even mentioned the word waffle house. Within 24 hours two of us had seen ads on Facebook about wafflehouses, and the other friend had seen a film clip on Instagram with someone making waffles in it as part of it (farfetched, I know.)

Another one. I'm currently traveling in South America. Last week on a jungle tour of the Amazon I found a bright red and black seed in the ground. My tour guide explained it was the seed of a tree and is popular as jewelry for this area. (iquitios) I have NEVER seen this seed before. The next day there is a post in my Facebook about a warning about this specific seed, and how it's 10x as toxic as ricin when injested. Again, probably coincidence. But I found that on the last day of my jungle tour and as soon as I got back in internet range it was at the top of my feed.

A few weeks later I’m on Facebook. Sometimes Facebook will suggest names and to my surprise the tumblr/Kik user was in the suggested on their own with their full name and I recognised them instantly. I never searched for them or their username.

the_other_him,1509333117.0,1,I would find it funny if this happening because a different app (say google translate) is listening to your conversations and picking up on these keywords.

Hence the 1-2 day delay in  these ads hitting your Facebook feed.

FB approached us several years back and had us beta test this feature. Essentially if their phone picked up a very specific recording via the microphone in the background, the user was retargeted with one of our ads when they were next on Facebook. Worked like a charm. 

How do you prevent this? Disable microphone access on all FB owned apps, disable background app refresh, etc. Location is another one that can get real creepy. "

breakola,1509333765.0,1,"Isn't this just the Baader-Meinhof effect in action?

There must be thousands of topics and keywords discussed all day around phones but you never see any ads for those... but once you see one ad based on something talked about you instantly think it's something spooky/spy shit and forget the other 436 potential ad topics you discussed that day.

Another thought - You can do geo location based ads - for example if someone visits a location you can show them an ad regardless if they like or talk about a related topic... so perhaps in his town there's a cat fair and maybe he saw/heard lots of cat based ads in his local environment background building up to the event - that he never paid attention to because he has no cat - that subliminally promoted him to suggest using the cat topic. That's just as likely as secret mic recording (and more likely as it's available right now with the ad platform tools).

I'd like to see it done again using a foreign language based brand keyword (lets say a well known brand in Japanese)!

Don't get me wrong - I wouldn't put it past these ad platforms like Google and FB to do such things, I just think there are possibly other reasons."

captainblammo,1509333926.0,1,"This is not about your phone listening. Facebook, Amazon, Google and your phone provider all have supercookies about you that spread way beyond your phone. 

This is probably all super cookies sharing ad data between people. Shared IP address? Have other computers in your house? In a relationship on Facebook? Other people visit your house with similar interests then get on your WiFi? Are you friends on Facebook? Did people you are related to shop for things before your birthday then visit? These are all metrics that can be shared between companies and then served up through ads on your Facebook feed.

I suppose it is possible that “something” is listening.  Your phone if you have it set to always listen, your Xbox. Any home device like the echo or whatever.  They may be pulling keywords for ads and selling those metrics.

The final place ads get served up to Facebook but that doesn’t mean Facebook is listening.

jarjarhall,1509334799.0,1,"I work in an advertising agency and I can confirm there are ways publishers can listen to you through your devices. It is not a common practice and it is extremely expensive. If a small brand like this cat food brand is targeting you I am almost 100 sure they are not using this technology. That being said publishers are getting extremely good at predicting what types of products or services users are in the market for.  There are a lot of different tactics, most people think of keyword targeting or retargeting (when you visit a site and then you see ads for that site somewhere else). These two are very common practices but they are just the tip of the iceberg. One thing you to consider is how many ads we see in a day, a majority of them we don’t notice because we block them out. We are exposed to 1000 of brands a month. Combine that with a heightened awareness of every add on your feed and it’s very likely you will find something. I have never owned a cat, talked about a cat, or a even searched cat videos but I definitely have seen several cat food ads in the last few months. Advertising moves a lot faster than 1-2 days, if they talked about the need for cat food extensively advertisers would have moved a lot faster and they would’ve seen multiple brands in the same day. One brand is definitely not the only brand that would be leveraging this golden insight on the consumer. Brands know that they cannot only target those who visit their site and people who search for a keyword because their is not a large enough audience. Most brands spend most of their advertising budgets on “prospecting” which is essentially guessing who would need their product based on the thousands of data points in your digital footprint. Yes brands know who you are and yes this video is interesting, but based on the situation I don’t think this video proves anything."

I rarely eat Mac and cheese, I don’t talk or search for it, and I didn’t even purchase any. The NEXT day, all of my instagram ads were for Annie’s Mac and cheese. 

2) after FaceTiming for about an hour with my grandparents who live in Mexico, and speaking to them in Spanish, all of my ads on Facebook were being advertised in Spanish. None of my language settings on my apps or my phone are set up in Spanish.

markt85,1509336991.0,1,"I think I've figured something out. I noticed some people saying it happening even if they turn off mic privileges for an app. My new hypothesis is at least for android is that it is an embedded google service that is recording regardless. I remember if you go to your google account and visit activities you can see every action taken on your phone. That is scary on it's own. Then just tonight I noticed with a good pair of headphones on if I open an app I hear a very low level vibrating noise. Doesn't matter what the app is, the second you activate it the noise begins. I think this is interference from the mic while it is activated and my headphones. Close the app and go back to home screen and the noise stops. It also stops while typing on the keyboard. Makes sense since it wouldn't need to record to get keywords while your typing. Could anyone with an Android phone, google now activated, and headphones confirm this?

Edit: I should note I'm using headphones with a built in mic.
Edit 2: I think my headphones were just fucking up lol, it doesn't do it anymore after disconnecting and reconnecting them."

RedSquirrelFtw,1509337653.0,1,"I've seen this first hand myself.  Freaky as shit.  I think it may not only be FB but Google too, as Android does all sorts of spying on you, while with FB, I think your browser would need to be open for it to work, and I've had instances where a website wants to use the mic and I get to deny it (I use a DTEK50 which has better security for this stuff) so don't think it would work all the time anyway, but the OS itself probably bypasses any of that security.  I would imagine that Google sells a lot of this data to FB and other big orgs.  I know that CC companies also sell data to Google as I have seen ads based on IRL purchases.

Recently I was at work, at a NOC, and we were busy because there was some major power outages going on and our conversations were mostly work related.  DMS 1U's battery power, generators, phones, and other telecom terminology.  I decide to check FB real quick, first ad that pops up is a tshirt ad targeted at NOC technicians.   

Not only is it spying on keywords but think it even understands context.  Since I would have expected to see ads for generators or batteries or other words that we mentioned, but the fact that it recognized I was at a NOC or work for one is kinda freaky. "

uglyzombie,1509353249.0,1,"It's not Facebook. It's your phone. I'm sure Android phones do it as much as iPhones. I'd be interested if Android users notice similar behavior.

However, as an iPhone user, I'm painfully aware of this in general, as it has happened to me consistently for the past couple of years. 

For instance, Gmail - I use it pretty much exclusively for e-mail. For years I got inane advertisements for stupid shit that didn't make sense. Randomly, one day, I get an ad for MILF Singles that kind of took me by surprise because a) it was out of the ordinary for the normal food advertisements I would get because I order out a lot, and b) nothing in my behavior would cause an algorithm to clandestinely pin this as a thing I'd be interested in. 

Then I remembered a few nights prior, I was drunkenly reminiscing with a friend that I dated an older woman in her mid-30s when I was in my twenties, and how amazing the... energy ... was.

Lo and behold. It's not a bullshit tinfoil hat conspiracy. It's what you sign up for when you buy these phones and don't read the fine print. I'd be interested in the details when someone smarter than my self reads the whole blob of ass and determines that we're not crazy.

Because I honestly don't think we are. It's not secret that the entire tech industry is now based on user data and behavior. Monetizing through ads to make services free forces growth in the advertising sector which is notorious for finding ways to know what makes you ""tick"". There is systematically and logically zero reason why this wouldn't be the progression of advertising in these times.

The next day the german girl who doesnt post anything about or search google for icelandig horses she opens her fb and boom: Advertisement to go on a riding trip with icelandig horses in iceland. The advertisement couldnt be more specific and it was litterally what we were talking about. I deinstalled fb of my phone and canceled microphone permissions for messenger. Dont have instagram.

Julius_Magnus,1509312382.0,1,"This is absurd. Facebook is not listening to your conversations, and it is much more likely that they used some other channel to gather this information.

First, the iPhone is not going to allow Facebook to constantly use the mic without permission, and is certainly not going to allow its use while the app is not open. 

Second, Facebook does spy on you in other ways, mostly through browser cookies. It can see the websites you visit and what you are looking up (I'm not sure of the depth of the collection, but it is rather disturbing). It also collects data about your friends and if they were searching for cat food, maybe the website's algorithms thought you would like cat food too. There is no need to go to the expense and trouble of listening to you talk and parse through the nonsense. 

Third, the guy in this video could easily be lying, and have been searching for cat food on Facebook to get the desired ad. This is so easy to fake and has been a rumor for years.

I'm not defending Facebook because I like the website, I don't. But disliking something does not mean we should abandon reason.

science_novice,1509314908.0,1,"Facebook is not listening to you. Because they can't. The technology to do that cost-effectively doesn't exist yet. Voice recognition requires a ton of processing power. [This Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/) points out that if every android user used voice search for 3 minutes a day, Google would have to *double* the number of data centers it has. There is no way that Facebook has the processing power to listen to everything that all of its users are saying 24/7.

I think that all of these user reports are combinations of coincidence (think of how many users Facebook has! Surely there will be *some* creepy coincidences!) and the [Frequency illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Frequency_illusion) or Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon. Wikipedia describes it as ""The illusion in which a word, a name, or other thing that has recently come to one's attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency shortly afterwards"". In other words, Facebook was always serving *some* cat food ads, but you don't notice. You start talking about cat food, and then all of a sudden you notice the cat food ads that were always there."

The Process is as Follows:

1. **Observation**

2. **Hypotesis**

3. **Preparation/Parameters**

4. **Experimentation**

5. **Results/Discussion**

* **For Observation**, this fellow and his wife were talking to each other, making calls, and other forms of communication on the phone. Fellow or wife noticed that there was an ad on Facebook for something they do not need/have no use for. 


* **For Hypothesis**, this fellow and his wife said Facebook was listening in on their conversations and looking for keywords to direct the appropriate ad to them.


* **For Preparation/Parameters**, this fellow and his wife opened up Facebook and Messenger and made the subject of their topic, cat food. Fellow and wife would be talking about getting cat food for an hour.


* **For Experimentation**, Fellow and his wife left Facebook and Messenger open in the background, and began talking about cat food for One hour. After One hour, Fellow and wife ceased cat related discussions and timed the Topic/Advert interval. The Advertisement appeared on Facebook 48 hours after Topic Discussion.


* **For Results/Discussion**, Fellow and his wife reviewed their findings: The Advertisement appeared on Facebook 48 hours after Topic Discussion. Fellow and wife then described the process of performing the experiment and the results that ensued, Allowing their findings to be peer reviewed.


TL;DR They scienced their findings."

Like, cat food ads just appear from time to time, you know? There are lots of cats on the internet. Something triggered it. Good science would show, statistically, that mentioning cat food increases cat food ad frequency.

vishnubob,1509322500.0,1,"Technically component folks will apply Occam's razor and see that, if such a claim were to be true, there would be measurable side-effects of such a process.  This could be measured by tools like packet sniffing, bandwidth utilization, battery life, etc.  Based on the comments here, there is zero proof of these side-effects, in spite of people looking (it's not hard).

Without a technical background, I have a hard time imagining how someone could measure their claim one way or another. The rational explanation, that these ads are based on associative data that we give away for free, does present one problem for most people. If you trace out what the rational explanation says: ""YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL"", then you can see why a naive person might reject it (even if they realize this is the reason or not)."

No human is listening to your conversation about cat food with your wife and also listening in on the segments about your family or your financial situation. It's automated. It literally is just a bot that listens for nouns you use a lot and if that noun is a product with advertisements being sent around, it will show you them. It would be EXTREMELY inconvenient for Facebook to have to hire someone to listen to every phone with Facebook installed round the clock, and even more inconvenient to have to dedicate an unthinkable amount of storage space towards saving the conversations of all those people. 

Advertisements are not inherently bad. Most people hate advertisements because they don't care about the product and the ad just ends up being clutter they have to sit through. A system that only shows you advertisements for products you need would be wonderful. I genuinely don't understand how people can see all of this and still think ""Durr but da robot is listen to me, dats bad because technology is advanced enough for robots to taKE OVER EARTH BY SELLING US CATFOOD"""

ryao,1509345045.0,1,"Correlation is not causation. These could be coincidences. I suggest that someone who suspects this monitor network activity to see if data is being sent to facebook’s servers while they are saying keywords. It is difficult hard to do on a cellular phone without risking contamination of the results, but you can do it easily on a Wi-Fi only tablet if such a device is suspected. I say that it is difficult to do on a cellular phone because if such malware does exist, you must monitor in a way that malware cannot detect to avoid triggering anti-analysis mechanisms, such as itself trying to hide. You could try airplane mode, but the malware might not operate in airplane mode. You could try running tcpdump on Android, but the malware might not operate when tcpdump puts the NIC into promiscuous mode. You would need a LTE capable stingray device to watch the data network while running tcpdump at your router (if you use Wi-Fi) to be certain that you are monitoring everything without any malware running being tipped off, then you can watch for unusual network activity. If you find the activity, you have proof.

Also, cat food is a very common subject. If you are going to try to see if they serve you ads that correlates with what you discuss and you want to make it something unlikely to be by chance, it would be easier to pick something that only a small sliver of the population would care about seeing but someone with deep pockets would want advertised. Say an obscure disease with an extremely expensive treatment, that would be far more convincing than cat food. I could easily believe tens of thousands of people suspecting such a thing, doing the same cat food test done in the video and hundreds of them just seeing a cat food ad by pure chance.

Edit: The possibility that people would lie had not occurred to me. After reading other comments, I agree that this evidence could easily have been faked. I do think it is possible for it to have happened by coincidence."

They would have to bypass the phones built in security, risk their reputation, and do it in a way that no one has been able to discover and prove that it is happening, but it is possible. I think the far more likely scenario is that they are just really good at data mining from your internet traffic, and from your friends internet traffic. And you probably see hundreds of ads in a day - if you are talking about a specific kind of product, odds are you will see an ad for it at some point, but you will only remember it when you are looking for it."

Two things going on here: extremely sophisticated ad serving based on web history, and the psychology of coincidence. The first is obvious. You may not search for ""thermostat"" or ""belt,"" but you search for a ton of things and visit myriad websites, and very smart people are crunching this data.

On coincidence: remember the ""astounding 25 parallels between Lincoln and JFK""? Here's the thing: there is literally an infinite number of pairs of data points for AL and JFK. Physical characteristics, geographical characteristics, educational characteristics; all of the above for their wives, siblings, ancestors, and on and on and on. For example: ""Abraham Lincoln's great grandfather had a splitting headache that lasted for a week, AND SO DID JFK's!""

1) For Father's Day, my wife got me a grill. I hadn't been shopping for a grill or searching for anything grill-related, but she knew the old one was giving me hell. The very first time I opened my phone after receiving this gift and we had been talking about it, all my FB ads were for grills. Even down to the exact brand name she got me.

2) Fast forward to last week.The wife signed up for a new meal delivery service. I had never heard of it before. I didn't know she signed up for it until the box came. Asked her about it, we discussed it. The next time I opened FB, the first ad I saw was for the exact meal delivery service we just received. Again, I didn't even know this company existed.

SuperJetShoes,1509323476.0,0,"OK so I have a similar anecdote which has been bothering me for months. Over lunch I was telling a friend of mine about a colleague who married a Malaysian muslim girl. It's a convoluted (and quite interesting) story, and we were discussing the ramifications for a good forty minutes or so.

That evening I was served up an Google AdSense ad for a Muslim dating site. I am a married British atheist. This was absolutely not related to anything I had typed or referenced on my phone or desktop. Also, I was working at a customer's site, so I had not been searching, browsing or reading news articles which may have been related.

I am not a conspiracy theorist and this bothered me. But I genuinely, honestly have no other explanation for this other than that our long conversation was eavesdropped and dissected by an unidentified software component.

Edit: I did consider confirmation bias: but that would only apply if ads were randomly served across all topics, as in a TV commercial break for example. But they aren't; they are targeted at my interests."

Not saying that it's even true, it's just a coincidence, but if it were true you allowed Facebook to do that by saying 'yes you can access my microphone'

You surround yourself by technology then act surprised when you're being recorded?

True privacy doesn't really exist anymore unless you seperate yourself from all these devices. Almost anything you use collects data and sends it to a server somewhere.

Anyone who works in the Ad industry and understands AdTech knows how you're tracked. 

Facebook provides tracking pixels to help advertisers track sites you've been to. This video claims they didn't visit any sites but one could fake this video for views so easily it's stupid. 

If you have an Ad that ""Follows you around"" this is due to a tracking pixel that was placed when you visited a site.

For example, you visit a company's site but don't buy anything. They have a tracking ID that says you didn't purchase and they placed you in a ""likely to purchase"" type ad group. Then they focus advertising dollars on the ""likely to purchase"" or ""likely to desire our services"" type groups.

alexjewellalex,1509340662.0,0,"Aside from the fact this is not only unlikely from  technical perspective, it’s unreasonable from a long list of other perspectives people have mentioned here. That being said, data is collected and analyzed about us and for us almost constantly. Sometimes that data analysis results in something useful, such as an immediate ad for cat food after googling, “best thing to feed a kitten,” and sometimes it isn’t. Whatever the case, privacy is a very synthetic construct, mostly comfortable to you strictly because you like the tension of differentiating between (a) what is objectively yours and (b) what you’ve agreed to subjective use by an abstract “them.” In other words, privacy makes you feel important, uniquely you, special, powerful - you and only you decides who knows and understands what about you. But that’s shortsighted; it fails to truly appreciate the quality of life we can have when we start freely and critically re-examining privacy and which areas of our lives are private, how they’re private, and for what purpose. For example, some AI picking out keywords from my everyday conversation to market to me isn’t dangerous. If anything, over time, it becomes more useful - it might remember things I could otherwise have forgotten. However, my neighbor being able to creepily listen in on everything said within my house through a vulnerability in my WiFi - that’s a potentially dangerous and serious issue, and it certainly isn’t useful. So, making sure we understand things contextually, and that the enforcement of contextual security is thoroughly designed and developed for, is undoubtedly crucial as the data age envelopes every facet of our lives. Arguably, to affect them for the better. It’s up to us to not fear the natural progression of our technology, but to make room for it. "

It'd be pretty easy to see what permissions the Facebook app has and whether or not the microphone is being accessed. The most likely explanation is that someone discussed something with their significant other (product/service/etc) and they googled it on their home computer or on their phone. If you use the same browser (Chrome for example) on your computer and phone they share info (bookmarks, etc). If you don't use an adblocker then sites have cookies that follow you around the web. You searched for whatever product or service and now you are getting ads for whatever it was you searched for or something similar. For example, you searched for diapers and now your getting ads for baby wipes or other baby-related items.

If Facebook really was listening to your conversations it would be even more of a battery hog than it is now plus it would be an unbelievable invasion of privacy. They would be sued and their image tarnished. They don't need to listen to your conversations. They have enough info given to them by users themselves.

2) It would seem a bit illogical for Facebook to promote an ad for something like 'needing cat food' 2 days later if they had the ability to listen in like the video likes to believe. They would want that ad up the next day at a minimum. (Not too soon to make it obvious.)"

edit: ok well, as someone who's written iOS apps and just in general understands what it would take to pull off something like this.. this is simply not possible. 

- If the phone is doing text to speech analysis, and it was on constantly listening to conversations and processing them, your battery would last 45 minutes tops

- If the phone isn't doing text to speech analysis then this data is being uploaded to the cloud, and the processing is done there.. you would use a lot of data, also the phones battery would probably only last you a few hours.

- Apple doesn't allow use of any iPhone's peripheral unless a user approves it periodically. If Facebook is using your Mic you would get a permission request for it.

If you go to the extreme saving battery mode on 100% and just use your phone for voice calls and talking, it can potentially last maximum three days longer than your average battery time in some cases.

mrv3,1509307211.0,1900,"There's an easy, relatively speaking, way to get Scientific proof.

Record the entire process, no cuts, nothing.

1. Buy an iPhone

2. Open the box

3. Install facebook

4. Make a new facebook account 

5. Since it's autumn mention nothing but hammocks.

6. Do nothing else on the phone just plugged in

If you get ads for hammocks it's 100% confirmed facebook is listening. 

What I suspect is happening is this

1. Facebook is recording 100% of the time in a low bitrate format (mp3-mono) probably 32kbps

2. If there is noise below a threshold it discards the information

3. When the device is inactive it processes the audio listening for keywords (cat food, etc) on device

The low bitrate is to conserve device memory, the discarding silence is because it's useless it processes on device to prevent upload monitoring (also it'd be higher usage)

This explains the battery drain from facebook, the limited nature of the ads themself. And yes you can 100% do voice recognition on 32kbps mp3, just tested it myself heck you can probably go even lower. An hour of recording at say 10kbps (which I believe usable VR can still be obtained) would be 33mb of data which could be processed every hour so it would still use up device storage but significantly less than one might imagine to do this."

My girlfriend and I were driving around a couple months ago and she mentioned that she was upset about an anniversary present that she got me because she messed up one of the details. The present was a poster that's made for you based on the day and location that you met. You provide that info and they show a star map of what the night sky looked like when you met. It's a cute idea, but not something I ever knew existed. Anyway, she told me about this around a month before our anniversary because she purchased the poster, but accidentally used the wrong date so she was upset that she bought the wrong one. I don't have any FB apps on my phone, but a few days later I started to see ads for these posters on my desktop feed. I thought it was weird so I asked my GF where she bought the poster from and it was a different company than the one being advertised. She only uses her work computer, so there's no way there was any browsing history related to the posters on my desktop.

From all of this, I gathered that Facebook picked up on our convo from her phone, that I was the one dating her since our relationship is on FB, that our anniversary was soon and then began serving me ads to buy this poster to commemorate our anniversary about a month before it occurred. "

Some thing with shampoo and conditioner, my gf was talking to me about running out of conditioner and I mentioned that I needed to change shampoo. You guess what ads FB showed me.

I had other similar instances like the ones I mentioned, probably more if I'd pay more attention at the ads.

Oh and btw, it wasn't like we talked about those items all day long, just regular conversation, so there's that.

Sure enough, later that same day, he had advertisements for websites selling that piece of networking equipment right on his Facebook feed.

Not that I can prove we were talking about them but they are strangely specific. It's no secret that both IG and Facebook listen. 

The weirdest thing that ever happen was I was looks at a coworkers Keen brand work boots and wondering if anyone else made good work/hiking boots and an ad for Merrell chemical proof work boots popped up which is again, strangely specific. I know this ones a stretch. I don't think it read my mind but that's weird. 

As I'm typing this I'm talking about a house cleaner with my girlfriend and she got a ""house keeper"" ad

I didn’t google it because I’m familiar with it. Anyway, targeted ad for plantar faciitis pops into my FB.  Fortunately, I saved the text to my wife.

This came after suspicions when my neighbors and I were playing wiffleball in the back yard. We only had 6 of us so we were constantly talking about who should bat, play position, or pitch. The next day...t-ball ads.

I never even googled companies for cruises but it’s all we talked about for a week and then commercials on our streaming services and Facebook advertisements were all suggesting cruises and Royal Caribbean (the cruise line we talked about). Freaked me out- my girlfriend of course thought it was destiny that we were seeing the ads. Feels like dirty advertising for sure.

gospelwut,1509313119.0,1,"So, facebook also aggregates ads data from (3) agencies which basically correlate data to a hash of your email address. They don't really specify *how* they get the data either.

It would also be the passive mic on the phone (e.g. Siri, Google Now) selling the data to these 3rd party agencies which in turn sell the data to FB. 

The real test is if this happens with or without facebook app installed."

Next day amazon showing ads on Instagram for air mattresses. We never searched for them before the ad showed up either that’s why we were shocked. We only discussed it one night briefly and then the ad shows up. So either all apps collect that data from conversations or we got really really lucky that Instagram and amazon randomly thought we need an air mattress.  Keep in mind only air mattresses were shown, no other items related to road trips or vacations or camping, only air matresss. So was t just a video or some shit I searched earlier that correlates with an air matress. They spied on my ass. "

For months after I've been seeing their ads and I swear I never saw them before. I don't pay for cable so I don't watch traditional TV with commercials. I have uBlock origin as well as Netflix and hulu premium so when an ad actually gets through to me I tend to notice them. Mikes hard stands out. I dunno if maybe it's that phenomenon where you notice things after being introduced to them but I've always known about mikes hard. I also don't have Facebook but my girlfriend does and she was the one I was with. "
Cheesewithmold,1509313282.0,1,"Happened to me with the Amazon app. Granted I do have a cat and have searched for cat beds before, but it was a little weird when I was at a store with my mom searching for a cat bed to buy, when we started to discuss whether or not there would be better deals on amazon.

I take out my phone, and sure enough there's a notification from the amazon app about new deals on cat beds.

The timing of the notification could definitely just be pure coincidence, because, like I said, I did search for cat beds on the app before. But it's still a little creepy.

Facebook does do this 100% with text though. Anytime my friends and I talk about going out to eat, we're immediately bombarded with ads on facebook about nearby restaurants/deals. The timing is too perfect for it to be a coincidence. It's also happened multiple, multiple times."

TheMachinist456,1509317797.0,2,"Yeah, since Facebook denies that it listens to you this is very plausible.

HatchCannon,1509317252.0,1,"Yup, one should be very cautious what they allow apps to use. There are options on the new android OS to block specific permissions or you can root the phone on an older version and install XPrivacy (or something similar) to police that. "
rafffmal,1509322009.0,1,"> So even if FB is off but superfuncrack game is always on, and has access to the mic, they could be selling that info to advertisers that use FB platform. 

Advertisers that use the FB platform have no use for that information (on FB). FB decides who the ads get served to. Advertisers can't specifically pick who they target, so knowing the names of people interested in their product wouldn't help their FB ad numbers. FB would be the one to buy the data and distribute the ads accordingly, not the ad companies."
Rasputin1942,1509323081.0,1,"Exactly this. 
Are you using any other app owned by FB? 
Or even more likely, are you using any other app or game delivering ads with Facebook Audience Network?

Iavasloke,1509330062.0,1,"I think it’s google. Facebook and Google tell each other everything, so whatever the G-man knows, that F’er is gonna find out before long. 

I deleted all google apps on my phone a few years ago & started using incognito in my mobile browser whenever I looked anything up. I erased everything from my google profile and permanently signed out. I felt like the targeted ads decreased in both volume and relevance to my recent experiences.

About two years ago, I started deleting fb every week because I hated how much of my mobile memory it used. I noticed another drop in the accuracy in targeted ads. That was around the time I first heard of this (the apps might be listening), so I keep off my phone for good now.

But see, I know they recognize me even when I’m not using their apps. Short of having a dumb phone, or at least treating your phone like it, there’s no way to avoid this shit. So, about a year ago, I started a new phase of my rebellion against targeted advertising. I call it “Are You Bastards Sure You Want My Information?”

I google something random a few times a week, click the first image or Wikipedia article that comes up, then scroll & click through random images and links until I’m about ten+ layers deep. I do the same thing on amazon every other time I use it. Now my ads are all over the fucking place, exactly where I want them. 

Fuck you, advertisers. You don’t know me! Fucking *nobody* has ever googled “Chandra Gupta,” “AR15 pajamas,” and “homemade toothpaste” in the same five minutes, and now you assholes don’t know *what* to sell me. HA! HAHA! HAHA-HAAAA!!

Murjinsee,1509340999.0,1,"I've read through several companies' privacy policies at length.  One thing that oftentimes shows up in the fine-print is that, while they do not sell your data/record your audio/use your camera/etc., companies have sharing arrangements with their partners, some of whom may be in the business of doing just that.

It's kind of like how governments say they don't spy on their own citizens, just on people in other countries; they leave domestic spying to overseas partners in order to avoid being accused of such things, then have some kind of reciprocity agreement in place.

Facebook knows the optics would be horrible if they were the ones recording your every spoken word, then serving relevant ads.  I have personally experienced this effect to an alarming degree, so I know that it is taking place, I just think Facebook lets other people do some of their dirty work and vice versa."

You must be wondering, like most people, why do people like me think it's ok for Google to """"""spy"""""" on me, but not Facebook?  

It comes down to consent. No one gave consent to FB to do this. And when a company gathers your data against your will, then it heavily suggests they may be doing things with our data we don't approve of.  

On the other hand, for Google, for example, we either have to opt in to a lot of that stuff (especially on newer Android versions, with each and every app now required to *ask* you permission to access certain features and parts of your phone like the mic, contacts, etc - and why FB app ignores this, idk...), or, we are made well aware if a Google feature is doing X or Y and we are usually given the option to opt out.  

That's the big difference. I know when and why Google is collecting my data, and I filter out what I don't want and keep what I do. Track my location to make it easier for Maps to Assistant to give me up to date routes? Sure. Collect analytics to improve my ad experience? No thanks, I block ads anyways and would like to save my data/battery.

I have a positive story about using the location tracking aspect of Google Maps. 

When I go out to new restaurants and stores, I usually check-in in the app, answer questions about businesses and occasionally write reviews/post pictures. Its set up where you can somehow earn points for adding all this information and if you use Maps for these things often enough, you become a Local Guide. 

I have the Local Guide status so my maps ends up tracking my activity **thoroughly**. Measured by location. 24/7. Even when you move. 

At a wicked fun Halloween party last night, I had one or more than enough glow in the dark jello shots and let's just say I got spooky drunk. My friends had all left the party that i was at, so I was on my own. Today I woke up safe in my bed and realized that I couldn't remember half of my night. The only way I could piece together how I fractured a bone in my foot, where I was driven, and how I got home was by looking at the activity tracker and location history in Google Maps. It literally broke down, minute by minute where I spent my night. I won't go into specifics but because of that, I now know exactly what happened.

DeviantShark,1509322679.0,4,"I recently read through Android Security Internals by Nikolay Elenkov - chapter 3 talks about disabling apps a bit. They are embedded in the Read Ony system partition if I remember correctly, and because you cannot WRITE (thus, delete) to that partition, you cannot uninstall them. However, updates to the app have to be written, and are not written to the system partition, but to data. So when disabling an app this gets removed, and the manifest sets the application as disabled. This removes the capability to run the app, and also allows you to remove user settings. So when the app is disabled it cannot be run, thus stays not in the background, and there is no linkage to your person because of the removal of userdata. Disabling is fine. It's just annoying that the space is still in use."

You're only paranoid about Facebook because of the public controversy. And the funny thing is... you're going through all this effort so you don't see some tailored ads? No, wait, it's probably because you don't want the world to find out you're gay, or that you have a rash on your butt, or maybe you impregnated the neighbor.

That's why you can download a flashlight app and it wants read and write data, or use your contact info, or needs access to your keyboard.

Facebook then thinks; this person must know your friend somehow, if he's looking them up, along with the fact you both have a mutal friend.

That makes a very simple and logical explanation. Nothing funky in the slightest. "

BlueberryGreen,1509313996.0,42,"Exactly. The test could easily be cheated on, it isn't convincing as an experience.

That's very 1984-ish stuff, with the telescreens and all.
Anyway, I digress. 
I'd have to do the test myself or see a correct demonstration (last case scenario: FB admits, which they won't) to be convinced of this. 
I'd encourage everybody to be more critical thinking. Facebook being bad guys doesn't allow us to accept whatever is thrown against them. "

Either way, this is the only issue I have with this because I just can't think of a way they would be able to do it without one of those two and both seem unlikely.

At best, if they were gaming Apple, Apple should fine them to death or at least publicly shame them. And Apple can very easily find out."

My specific example that I also posted below is: When my cat died last year, I started getting targeted ads on my Facebook for a very specific pet cremation service that allows you to keep your pet's ashes in a locket necklace or a bracelet, etc. I was really paranoid because those are pretty specific and morbid ads. I can't say for 100% certainty, but I do not believe I searched pet cremation in Google, etc.

At the time, I just reduced it to Facebook taking data from WhatsApp as I was texting my friends on WhatsApp about my cat's passing.

And apps are constantly waking up to do permitted housekeeping.

If you gave any app access to your microphone or telephone, it can listen when the screen is off, and the OS is not actually doing anything to prevent that.

Let’s say you’ve been getting cat ads because you fall into the right demographic profile, but you don’t really notice them (most ads are viewed for less than a second). Then your friend tells you she just got a cat. Bingo, now you noice the cat ads because the topic is on your mind. 

2. The Friends Network. Facebook doesn’t just show information based on your behavior; it also reacts based on the behavior of your closest friends. So even if you really weren’t getting cat ads before, now that your friend has been searching the topic nonstop, you get the ads too. Over time, if you either hide or ignore the ads, Facebook will realize you’re not interested in cats and they’ll go away. "

Lemme give you 2 explanations that would wouldn't involve surreptitious recordings:

1. OP probably told at least one friend about this who has cats and who actually thought ""oh! I actually need to order cat food!"" ... So they visited a website and ordered more. 

Facebook let's you analyze all the visitors of your website and create another group of people who are on Facebook that haven't chatted your website, but are very similar to those who have.  It wouldn't be shocking if the friend they told who ordered the cat food was a lot like OP (people hang out with similar minded people). 

2. If I'm OP's neighbor and he told me about this and I know his email address, I could run an ad targeted at him about cat food just to freak him out. "

staviq,1509321786.0,1,"**It would NOT be a ""TON of bandwidth""**.

First of all, data could be processed locally for minimum bandwidth required.

Second, recognition does not need the full audio to be transmitted, only so much of it so it can be understood by computer.

Third, and most important, **There is no voice recognition involved at all**, it's a very simple patter matching, software does not need to understand what you are saying, only if any part of the audio matches the sample database

Radio Shack sold VCP200, a voice *recognition* chip that utilised sample matching, in **1980's**, and it was based on a ~8MHz or so CPU, that is several orders of magnitude slower that typical phone CPU nowadays.

Pickle_Tickle,1509323965.0,1,"At a certain point enough anecdotes add up to become something worth looking into further. I'll offer my anecdote: this happened some months ago. I have an android phone (samsung) with facebook app and messenger installed and used pretty regularly. I was having a conversation in my kitchen with a grandparent with my phone in my pocket. I was talking to said grandparent (who doesn't have a cellphone or use the internet at their home) about how I saw one of those funny 3-wheeled motorcycles on the highway when I was driving (alone) an hour earlier. I thought about the name for a minute, then remembered the TV spots that I had seen years before and said ""Oh, yeah. They're called Can-Am Roadsters"". We talked about this for a minute or so and then moved on and forgot about it. Just *hours* later I was being served Google embedded ads for Can-Am three-wheel vehicles through Chrome and RedditIsFun on my phone. Asked grandparent (who was still there) if they had mentioned it to anyone else and they hadn't. There were *zero* microphones in that room except for my phone. Neither of us ever typed it in to any device or breathed a word about it to anyone else between our conversation and the ads appearing. I have *never* searched for those products. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but no one can tell me that my phone wasn't listening to me from my pocket on that occasion. Another user offered an explanation for why this sort of monitoring might be plausible:

> What I suspect is happening is this
> 1. Facebook is recording 100% of the time in a low bitrate format (mp3-mono) probably 32kbps. If there is noise below a threshold it > discards the information.
> When the device is inactive it processes the audio listening for keywords (cat food, etc) on device.
> The low bitrate is to conserve device memory, the discarding silence is because it's useless it processes on device to prevent upload monitoring (also it'd be higher usage).
> This explains the battery drain from facebook, the limited nature of the ads themself. And yes you can 100% do voice recognition on 32kbps mp3, just tested it myself heck you can probably go even lower. An hour of recording at say 10kbps (which I believe usable VR can still be obtained) would be 33mb of data which could be processed every hour so it would still use up device storage but significantly less than one might imagine to do this."
fuck_bestbuy,1509323985.0,1,">Yeah, this is bunk. iOS doesn't allow mic access like this. It would also be a TON of bandwidth that the user would definitely notice if it was pulling audio from your conversations. 

Clientside voice recognition, tuned in to relevant keywords. Not hard at all.

>As of yet, nobody has managed to find any conclusive proof that this sort of data has been sent to Facebook via audio. At all. Zero evidence. 

Which I find strange seeing as how many times I've seen this happen on Facebook. Only inside of the app. You'll say a keyword and then get advertisements based on that alone, without previously googling anything even remotely related.

Cybugger,1509318681.0,1,"> My guess, it’s just some algorithm that recognizes key words in speech, and automatically populates ads to fit those key words.

The way the data is gathered is irrelevant.

There is now an account for that person, and it in it is labeled data, probably under something like: Spoken Keyword. Associated to that account is now the word ""Cat food"". If FB goes into its database, and looks up all the accounts that looked/spoke about Cat Food, this account will be found.

Essentially, the algorithm does exactly the same thing as a warehouse full of people listening. In fact, that's exactly what the NSA does: it doesn't have people listening in. It has algorithms running 24/7 that trawl social media, incoming e-mails, out-going e-mails, and all the rest, and look for certain keywords.

Facebook is doing the exact same thing as the NSA.

When I create ads for clients I can get incredibly targeted, a very basic example; IOS version, smart device model, education level, 10 mile radius of an address - and whether or not you've engaged with my clients content in the past. Where it get's even more in depth is I can then create 'look alike"" audiences based on adsets I create, meaning that I can get ads in front of people who have never engaged with my client's content but whom match the 'average' profile based on the audience who does engage. It's hard to fathom the scale of just how much data is being crunched, but working with Facebook everyday on behalf of numerous businesses certainly makes me skeptical about Facebook needing to literally ""listen"" in order to serve content to users so effectively that they think they're being ""spied on""."

I mean we have so many reasons and proof that this is not happening, but like ""Vaccines cause autism"" this idea is probably not gonna go away anytime soon.. First and foremost we would notice either all the data being sent form our phones or we would notice the phone using like all its ressources to analyse it locally (cause analysing everything is really costly) But of course no one ever found either to be the case.

The only thing we have is stupid coincidences and confirmation bias. Look at what is actually happening in this video: Someone talks about cat food and proceeds to just wait until a cat food ad shows up. It took several days for this to happen! Now think about how many ads this person saw during this time. Probably hundreds and more. The chance of getting a random cat food ad is really high."

OrwellAstronomy23,1509362462.0,1,"Can you think of a way to run a better experiment? For instance you have to have a better random sample of what advertisements are displayed before introducing your independent variable/trying to manipulate it. This cant really be done in a day maybe make a note of what kind of ads and their frequency over a week or two. Then you can't just talk about one product for the experiment like is shown in this video because even if the item came up it could be coincidental. Try it several times over with different items, preferably the types of things you didn't really see previously in your advertisements. If its listening in to what your saying and adjusting ads then it should be manipulated by introducing several different topics/items at different times. If you're noticing a pattern where previously you had never seen ads for trampolines, street bikes, roller skates or whatever you may be talking about and they start popping up when your talking about them you may be on to something.

trickster721,1509330506.0,8,"Like, how could they possibly know so much, if all they had was every word you ever typed into a browser, and the identities of all your family and friends and everything they ever typed, and all the photos everyone has posted, and everyone's physical location at all times, and how long you spend looking at things on the screen before you scroll down?

This is exactly like the ""sudden acceleration problem"" that foreign cars in the US were supposedly having a few years ago, which was later shown to be the result of elderly people mistakenly pressing the gas instead of the brake. Strange that only foreign cars seemed to have that ""problem""."

wild_man_wizard,1509347684.0,1,"It wouldn't need to transribe anything.  You wouldn't need perfect transcription to sell ads, just a few percent better engagement. This focus on small margins is why directed advertising has a lot of allowance for false positives.  A directed advertising algorithm would just need to  cluster sounds into keywords.  A keyword seems to get repeated enough it gets flagged during normal traffic to facebook.    A low-fidelity NN/clusering algorithm is all it would take - it would be low-memory, low power, and it would be hard to prove exactly becasue it has so many false positives.  "

Edit: Thought of one other interesting occurrence: before I had my mic turned off for Twitter I looked at my ""twitter data"" or whatever and it had German as a language I spoke listed. I don's speak German... but my roommate does, in our house, all the time, in earshot of my phone. That's when I changed some of my settings.

It can get to the point where this technology seems like it's inside our own heads, like it's listening to our most private conversations. Because that's what it's *trying* to do.

QAFY,1509311389.0,289,"Some other theories (some far fetched, some not) to add to this:

Reasonable theories: 

- Probably not sending raw audio back to any servers (not that you were suggesting that). That would be too much data. Definitely processing keywords on the device and sending back hashed encrypted data that would make no sense if intercepted with something like wireshark. 

- To mask the cpu / memory usage they could limit it to the time you are using the app or to times you have your screen on and are actively using your phone. That way CPU / battery usage does not appear suspicious or show usage outside of expected times. 

Tinfoil hat: 

- They could also be simply buying this data from other sources. Phone manufacturers (wouldn't be the first or last time phones shipped with malware installed), or in the case of iPhone, maybe other apps that are collecting it. This way Facebook can totally deny recording you and be telling the truth. This would also get around permissions. Other less trusted apps also catch the heat for using battery / CPU in the background and get uninstalled instead of facebook.

- They could be correlating GPS data among dense networks like they already do for their numerous other algorithms in order to do things like only record on one microphone in a group or still capture audio from nearby phones if you have permissions set to deny access to the microphone and still associate that data with you. (holy run-on sentence batman)

- They could be selective about who they use this technology on. Older / less tech savvy people would probably never notice it. Younger people would probably catch onto it quickly. They might know this and only use it on more accepting groups. They might also stop using it on you if you search things related to facebook using your mic for ads. And yes, they know what articles you read... That little facebook share icon on news sites? That knows who you are logged in as and tracks you / phones home. 



EDIT: Anyone arguing that using the mic and doing this sort of keyword recognition would be too resource or network intensive, you are straight up wrong. Phones like the Pixel 2 listen with the mic 24/7 and can identify tens of thousands of ambient songs in the background (basically always-on shazam) completely offline and with no noticeable impact to battery life or CPU usage. Google keyboard speech to text dictation for the _entire english language_ works completely offline as well and is only a couple megabytes. It also would NOT send audio over the network. It would send tiny amounts of processed metadata back to Facebook which could be done in a couple packets, literally nearly undetectable."

ultio,1509313017.0,12,">What I suspect is happening is this

You're literally just making up stuff and pulling numbers out of your ass without ANY basis whatsoever. To say that one of the most utilized apps on the planet is secretly recording its users without anyone ever having found any such activity is just more than conspiracy theory levels of crazy, it's just plain stupid and the whole ""probably 32 kbps mono recordings"" is completely random pseudoscience and baseless and yet you are getting upvotes because  'it sounds like you are on to something'.

There is no way that Facebook is recording and analyzing conversations of hundreds of million of people on the end-user's phone. You would definitely be able to notice performance spikes in normal conversations or otherwise notice that the application frequently basically permanently wakes up the phone (and please don't reply ""Facebook uses 10% of my battery, so clearly that's evidence"", there are ways to analyze / debug the activity of running apps). Besides, Facebook even denies this and if this came out, it would be an absolute disaster for them. People like you are just diluting any actual scientifically acceptable analysis of something like this with crazy-levels of explaining the problem.

There are a dozen more likely options that others have already mentioned in this topic for why cat ads (or any other topic) would randomly appear. (""Mid twenties, female, uses reddit -> cat ads"")"

You’d have to buy a clean device, and go to a WiFi hotspot you’ve never been to (and preferably not close to your house), connect via a VPN that goes through another location and then try it. And don’t bring or connect any other phones, computers, etc that may have personal information on it.

That being said, on iOS if they are doing background microphone access wouldn't the system put some sort of banner across the top like it does on a phone call or navigation?

Targeting is also done by IP, so if he uses your wifi, or you use his, they can associate the two of you.  Someone on your IP or in your location looks up LTE speeds, and you get an LTE speed ad.

If they can't link you by location, or by friends, or by IP, many apps get your entire contact list (including Facebook).  So, if he puts you in his contacts, Facebook links the two.  Or if you are tagged in photos with him.  Or if you text him and he let Facebook be his SMS client.  Or, if your mother has both of you in her contacts.  Or if you have enough overlap in your friends.

JonnyAtlas,1509315385.0,2,"People have been responding with speculation and anecdotal evidence. I’ll try to be a bit more detailed.

To answer your question, doing that alone will likely not stop this from happening. I’ll explain below.

An important note: **this was only tested with iOS 10**. In iOS 11, Apple removed Facebook and Twitter’s OS-level integration. That *may* have solved this deeper issue. Further testing would be required.

My coworkers and I spent a couple days testing and trying to figure out how Facebook was still listening with these permissions turned off. Because it is.

Here’s what we learned:

Facebook has (or had, in iOS 10) OS-level API access. Because of the OS integration, Facebook was given complete access to APIs, on the same scale as the OS itself.

Because of this, disabling microphone and camera access to the Facebook app wouldn’t have any effect. Here’s why:

Facebook integrates with nearly every app on your phone. The Facebook service is able to request any data from those apps, provided you’ve allowed it to do so. For example, if Instagram has microphone and camera access (which most people leave on, since it’s an app for taking and sharing photos and videos), and you have Facebook integration turned on (which most people do, so you can have your Instagram posts push to your Facebook account as well), Facebook can request access to any camera or microphone data from Instagram. So Instagram will actively listen on behalf of Facebook and share that data.

Even without OS-level permissions, Facebook can still do this with any apps it has access to, via the app API.

There was speculation amongst my peers that, in iOS 10, Facebook could do this with the camera or microphone themselves - even without the handholding of other apps. We weren’t able to conclusively prove that, but the removal of the OS-level integration in iOS 11 tells me it was probably correct.

Long story short, uninstall the Facebook app, and limit access to the camera and microphone in every app. I only turn it on for Instagram when I’m posting a live story. Then I immediately turn it off again. The OS camera app takes better photos and videos anyway.

Uninstalling Facebook will increase your level of privacy, and will improve your battery life drastically."

Kozzwara,1509364923.0,1,I don't think even disabling your mic for FB apps is enough. I believe your device logs your voice and creates some sort of text file and this is what FB acquires. So even not allowing FB to have access to your microphone they still have a way around it. 
your_doom,1509313374.0,0,Facebook most likely knows some workaround for that.
Perfectionlumiere,1509309170.0,2204,Stuff like this happens to me all the time to the point where I started screenshotting the ads every time. For example.

bassinastor,1509314707.0,3,"People severely underestimate the sheer amount of information we’re in contact with regularly that can influence the ads we see. For example, a few weeks before my birthday I saw an ad on FB for a product that I thought was pretty cool. I thought about getting it but decided not to. Turns out that’s exactly what my gf got me for my birthday. There are a billion possible explanations for that. 
1. We both got the ad at the same time and that’s how my gf decided to get me that gift. 

2. My gf searched for that gift and I got the ad because of it. 

3. I clicked on the ad so my gf got the same ad later and got it for me. 

4. It was a popular item in our area so we got the ad. 

5. The item was featured in some article that my gf read so she got an ad for it. 

There are hundreds of possibilities besides our phones recording us talking about something. 


People also seriously underestimate how much subliminal advertising we’re exposed to. For example, maybe my neighbor bought some cat food and so I got an ad for it but didn’t even realize it. Later I want to test whether or not my phone is recording my conversations so I pick something totally “random” like cat food to talk about. And then amazingly, I get ads for cat food because now I’m paying attention to the ads. Or maybe me and a friend both read an article about home maintenance that briefly mentions air filters and then later we both “coincidentally”get ads for it after we talked about it. 



I’m not saying these ads aren’t invasive, in fact I think there should be stricter regulation on them, but these sorts of occurrences aren’t proof of your phone recording everything you say. Audio takes up a lot of memory as does voice recognition. If your phone was recording everything you said it would be taking up so much of your device’s memory that it would be impossible not to notice. It’s just not a realistic concern. "

erishun,1509325106.0,4,"The thing is that even people who have disabled the microphone are reporting similar issues. And Facebook denies they use the microphone in this way.

**I think this whole issue is that FB is just really good at knowing what you want combined with the fact that there are a ton of advertisers on Facebook.** You scroll past dozens of ads without thinking about it. It’s only when you look at each of them and think about it that you may notice patterns.

It’s a classic case of confirmation bias. It’s the same faulty logic that makes people believe in miracles. When you ignore all the evidence that doesn’t align with what you want to find, you think you’re special when you discover what you were looking for.

In the case of the video, the dude lives with his GF and presumably has no kids, so even though he doesn’t have a cat, Facebook has many advertisers and it makes sense that at some point you’d find a cat food company targetting not only “*likely owns cat*”, but “*people in relationships with no kids*”. 

So you scroll past the cell phone ads, you scroll past the car insurance ads, you scroll past the all those generic ads that target pretty much everyone with a pulse. You scroll past the engagement ring ads (if you’re male) and wedding dress ads (if you’re female) that you get bombarded with if you’re over 22 and in a relationship, but not married. You keep scrolling, keep loading ad after ad until you find the cat food ad and “BAM I TOLD YOU THIS IS PROOF”... it’s not, it’s a coincidence and the reason you’re seeing it is someone advertising on FB cast a fairly wide net and FB didn’t have any other higher cost, more focused ads to deliver to you at that point."

In daily life we spend most of our interpersonal conversations figuring out what each other like and how to either mutually enjoy those things, or manipulate others to get what we want. To say using your knowledge of psychology to make others do what you want them to do should be illegal, is essentially saying a large part of natural human interaction should be illegal. That's stupid as fuck. I'm sorry but as disturbing as it may be, advertising taps into something very innate to human nature.

Ubiquitous surveillance technology coupled with the application of subtle and sophisticated stimuli (ads, subliminal messaging, the works) targeting the subconscious allow for governments an unprecedented degree of social control. The beauty of that control is that it doesn't feel like control at all. It feels like convenience. It feels like it's a choice we're making ourselves. 

It's all very frightening, clearly; we see it for the dystopia that it is when it's in books like 1984 and Brave New World. But shit, we don't need to get that imaginative. It's happening before our very eyes, right now.  "

You have to understand the intent of these systems, and the advertisers they serve. They're collecting an immense amount of data on you. They analyze the smallest, most subtle behaviors to infer patterns. From these patterns, they can determine not just your preferences, but also your susceptibilities. With this data, they can sell a very enticing product to the highest bidder, a product that outperforms any traditional advertising. Algorithms can be employed to build psych profiles that could target someone with retail ads during a manic episode, for example. But it goes further than that. Advertisers don't just want to inform the desires of consumers, but to manufacture consumer desires completely. The greatest market is the untapped one, and with a wealth of user data, you can hit them where they're weakest, dropping little unassuming stimuli here and there until someone feels they want to buy something. When advertisers work in the subconscious, there's no ethical conclusion. It's increasingly effective manipulation, dictated entirely by profit. The endgame here is not a more convenient user experience, although they market it that way. The goal is to understand human behavior so as to manipulate human behavior. To do that, you need data. This is how that starts.

This isn't just tin foil hat shit, it's already happening. Targeted political propaganda, for certain susceptible populations, was already used on Facebook in the last election. More data makes this more effective. The more surveillance these companies perform, the more capable they are in controlling us.

But of course, ""bad"" is relative."

akkuj,1509312605.0,192,"> If you ever start a new job, watch how long it takes for facebook to start recommending your coworkers despite **you** giving it zero indication that you know them otherwise.

Bolded the keyword. Your recommendations are probably also based on their actions, eg. someone googled your name or looked for you on facebook or instagram. Also there's plenty of other ways to make that connection, eg. you have interest in similar subjects on google searches + shared locations or IPs with someone -> there's likely to be a connection between you two.

Reading comments on threads like this, I often get the feeling that people severely undestimate how much data can be extrapolated even from seeminglynon-intrusive data collection, like search histories, page visits and IPs.

3) This video could be fake.

4) Facebook might categorize you by using your friends' interests, age group, etc. and determine what you might be interested in. Facebook and Google both make a ton of money from advertising, so they spend a lot of money developing algorithms to predict what people want and are interested in based on all the data they can get their hands on.

Yes and no.  The problem with all these kinds of examples strewn throughout these comments is that it's really hard to work out how significant many (any?) of them are in isolation. Most are ""we mentioned [popular product], and within [time frame ranging from hours to days] we spotted an ad for [popular product] on our device!"".  Even if they *are* listening in, with a sample size equal to the population of Reddit's user base, you *should* expect to see this sort of thing by coincidence thousands and thousands of times.  A more modern twist on the cute little phenomena where once you learn a new word, you start noticing it everywhere.

That's not to say that they *aren't* listening in, just that it's really hard to establish based on the sort of loose anecdote that's currently being dumped in this thread.

This is a version of the Baader-Meinhof, noticing things you never noticed before after they become relevant. i.e. you buy a Toyota Sentra and then you start noticing how many Toyota Sentras are actually around.

Chances are the guy in the video saw cat food ads before and ignored them because they weren't relevant. They became relevant when he decided to make a test about cat food.

So he ignores all the other ads that he sees for the next two or three days, probably dozens or more and when he sees a cat food ad, he confirms his own beliefs.

Edit: I am a muy idiot because I forgot the beginning they state a lack of cats. Need to rewatch and reevaluate.

Edit 2: My guess would be that they or friends on Facebook have some kind of pet or have interests and likes involving pets or animal shelters.

I have the ability to emulate lots (100's) of android VM's, I'm thinking of doing an indepth test to see really how bad it is, but I would be shocked if the behavior would be the same in diagnotic, or emulated modes.

edit: also we know a couple of things in the way that this feature manifests itself. It can take days to show up, which means that the data is likely not being processed in real time. people talk about the processing speed required on the local scale, but that's only real time process intensity. you could take the same problem, artificially limit the amount of processor time it can use, and eventually come to analysis. for example, you can cache compressed results and wait for the phone to become inactive, and then use the CPU time when nobody else is around to notice. you could wait until the phone is plugged in, or connected to wifi with the screen off. 

additionally you could enumerate the instances of a pattern of vocallizations, ie ""pizza"". you're phone doesn't have to know that ""p-i-z-z-a"" is pizza, it just needs to know that multiple voices said it in a 5 minute period. we send the byte data for the sequence ""pizza"" (maybe 100 bytes or less if we've properly compressed it) and then upload that to our server with the enumeration. the server could process it to figure out what it actually means, and it knows you and all your friends are talking about getting pizza.

HarleysAndHeels,1509323910.0,1,"It has happened to me on more than one occasion. More specifically just last week. My husband and I talked about buying a fire pit for my Mom's backyard. He was telling me about it. I had not known up until that very moment that he was doing this for her birthday. I had not, nor had I ever Googled patio fire pits. 
Not less than a day later a patio fire pit showed up on my FB feed. 
Also, I was not on my phone at the time. It was in the room, but I was not on it. 
Last year I was on the phone with my sister discussing a particular type of paper I needed and was asking her about it. I had not yet looked it up on Amazon because I was driving.  By the time I got home and on my phone (had not looked it up yet) the exact kind showed up as a suggestion for purchase through Amazon on my FB feed. 
It most assuredly is happening. 
I'm on iPhone 6s, and I do have the FB app. 

Edit:  I took screen shots of text conversation with my husband on Oct 12th telling him about it popping up. Is it possible to show it here for proof?"
sunny001,1509316819.0,27,"another iOS developer checking in.

Although you're correct about apps accessing microphone without user knowledge, it is possible if they come across some private API. [Uber](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-threatened-travis-kalanick-over-ubers-app-in-2015-2017-4) was caught for tracking users after uninstalling apps. Facebook used to play inaudible soundtrack so that their app was always in the background (this was before background syncing APIs were introduced ~5yrs ago). Back then the only apps that were allowed to run in the background were music apps so by playing a soundtrack, iOS thought the app was playing songs when in reality Facebook was syncing in the background.

I also remember another incident where Uber app would track the IP address of users and they served a completely different version of the app if the IP was coming from Apple's Cupertino campus (Apple reviewers are there).

Apple has given Uber access to private [API] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/10/06/uber-app-could-secretly-record-iphone-users-screens/) when they launched the Apple watch. 

My point is Apple may or may not be directly involved in this. Facebook/Uber apps are known to bypass official API restrictions so this wouldn't surprise me much if it turns out to be true."

Yes, Facebook ""listens"" in terms of understanding and mapping your interests and behaviour, that of your friends and the content you engage with. When I create ads for clients I can get incredibly targeted, a very basic example; IOS version, smart device model, education level, 10 mile radius of an address - and whether or not you've engaged with my clients content in the past. Where it get's even more in depth is I can then create 'look alike"" audiences based on adsets I create, meaning that I can get ads in front of people who have never engaged with my client's content but whom match the 'average' profile based on the audience who does engage. It's hard to fathom the scale of just how much data is being crunched, but working with Facebook everyday on behalf of numerous businesses certainly makes me skeptical about Facebook needing to literally ""listen"" in order to serve content to users so effectively that they think they're being ""spied on""."

With fb and even some google products, people submit their full names, addresses, phone numbers, and comparable levels of identifying data about their family/friends, and even co-workers— most times, shortly after joining. In reddit, people don't share that kind of information, but over time, 'leak' who they are in (what they think of) as casual conversations ""with strangers.""

There was a novelty account here years ago that combed through profile pages and then listed pared-down facts of the users. It was kind of eerie to see it sometimes list the age, occupation, pets' names & ages, SO's gender, locations, and much more from 'anonymous' conversations."

ChickenPicture,1509316367.0,1,"The evidence given in the video is circumstantial at best.  Because of the short length, lack of explanation of methods, and what seems to be large lapses of time between cuts, we have no idea what they did before or during the ""experiment"", how long the experiment took place, no idea about the myriad other things they could have done to affect the experiment, and no way to be sure that the cat food ad wasn't truly a random advert.  Cat food is a pretty common thing to advertise.  To the point, I don't have a dog and I never talk about dog food but I saw a dog food ad on my facebook this morning.

One of the points that the guy made in the thread, was that a lot of the time when these things happen it's because people don't realize there are other ways that sites gather information that aren't related to listening to your mic.  For example, you may have googled something on your laptop a few days ago that was loosely related, or you may have shopped for something else on amazon but clicked on a different product just to look at it, or even by accident.  Facebook knows all the devices on a network are yours, so if little Timmy googles ""is cat food safe to eat"", three days later an ad pops up on mom's facebook for cat food.

I'm not saying it isn't feasible, I'm just saying there's a lot of fear based jumping on the un-informed bandwagon going on, and the uninformed part is all the crazy ways that advertising companies derive what they think you'll buy from them by looking at your GPS location, browsing history/search terms, ads you linger on more than a half second, and even vaguely related items that you search for or look at.

A video which has been edited together and shows a weak correlation at best is hardly sufficient enough to break out the pitchforks.  Come talk to me when a group of security researchers finds out that the facebook code somehow has a back door which forces the microphone to remain on regardless of the status of the app and in direct violation of what is permissible by the OS itself.  Until then it is simply a matter of correlation not being equal to causation."

Trump_Sucks_Dick,1509322943.0,6,"It's pretty easy actually. People are actually quite predictable and our actions don't differ a lot. For example, if I google ""bars open on a Sunday night in the local area"", followed by ordering take away for a week straight, and then spending a lot of time browsing for spare rooms and roommates, it wouldn't be unreasonable for google to put two and two together and start giving me adverts for divorce lawyers, despite me never mentioning the divorce or searching for it. The above can be applied to any situation. 

If that's not enough to convince you then think of the really obvious shit. How quickly does your battery on your phone drain when you're playing spotty or streaming audio?

Your phone generates a type of ""dna"" for your words. It filters out the common filler words like ""and"", ""it"", and other random unintelligible words. So what's left are just keywords in a condensed (non-audio) format.

I’ve had this issue anyway. One day I had a conversation with coworkers about smart thermostats. In the morning, he was telling me about his old turn dial thermostat that crapped out and how he wanted to try the Nest. I knew a few things about them having installed them in the past. We carried on the conversation at lunchtime, he told me about another brand he looked at. 

I picked up my phone after eating, and while following links on reddit, I was getting ads for Nest and Honeywell smart thermostats. All over the place. 

Mind you, I rent. I don’t really have reason to search any appliances or devices that might fit in with that. And I’m well aware of ads being catered to me based on what I search and look at. Instruments, car parts, gadgets. Always seeing whatever I just looked for on Amazon. But this was just *talked* about. My phone wasn’t open, I wasn’t using any apps. It was on the table or in my pocket. 


I’ve noticed it a few more times now since then. Pretty sure I’ve got very few apps that have microphone permissions set. So if they are picking up keywords, it’s against the BS permissions I’ve granted when installing the app. 


This goes beyond Facebook. And as harmless as it seems in this context, what it implies could be much more concerning. "
CplRicci,1509311975.0,755,"I caught onto this last year and went to uninstall FB from my phone only to find out that on the Galaxy S6 you cannot uninstall it,  only ""disable"" it, which in no way removed permissions.  Really bugged me and I made a huge stink about it.  Thankfully on the S8 it doesn't come preinstalled and I didn't install it.  This was the Verizon model.  
  
 
  Edit: Another user pointed out that preinstalled apps and their permissions are treated differently so if you uninstall or disable a downloaded app the permissions cease to exist but since it was included as a system app I was unable to disable some of the background processes by disabling Facebook. This led to my phone still reporting that Facebook was active and running processes. Jailbreaking would be a solution but when I owned tee phone there was no root access available for the Verizon S6 Edge so that was not an option.  
  
  
  Edit 2: Verizon ended up buying me out of the phone after I made a public stink on social media and I preordered the S8 plus. Has been a much different experience.  
  
  
Edit 3: this spurred a lot of conversation.  There are several forum posts on Verizon about it and they flat out say you can only disable the app and factory reset the app permissions but as I mentioned that didn't stop the processes from showing in my RAM usage readout. If it means a lot to you as well maybe check when buying a phone if social media is given unique permissions or preinstalled before you purchase a device.

If you talk about whiskey ice cube death star things and you get ads for random shit, you don't notice, but if the ad randomly shows the whiskey ice cube thing, you suddenly think you're being listened to.

Even if it is unlikely to happen - it will happen to some people but not to others, and the ones it happens to will remember and tell the story.

The rest is targeting. Did you view a web site about it? Of course you'll get ads for that (and not just on the device where you made the search, other devices on the same network too). Is it something that is interesting for your demographic? You'll probably see an ad for it once in a while.

The ""facebook listening"" thing doesn't make much sense. It requires too big of a conspiracy, ignores technical constraints (OS controls for mic access, power limitations), and is of limited use (online profile based targeting is already pretty good) especially compared to the risk (this sounds like it would be both jail time territory, and a massive loss of users)."

anotherlebowski,1509331214.0,1,"Not to deny that this is a thing, but I need more information to get onboard.  I've worked in digital advertising (not for Facebook), and there are many ways that an ad-serving site like Facebook could accurately guess products that are somehow relevant to you, even very specific products, such as:

-Your browsing history on specific product pages
-Your actual purchase behavior
Information you've filled out on a form somewhere on the internet
-Offline purchases
-Rewards programs linked to your email
-Search behaviour

There are companies whose entire business model is ""data provider,"" as in user data.  So if you happen to talk about a product near your phone, it may seem like your voice was the information source when it actually wasn't.

Now in the case that this is a very specific product as in your example, it's possible an exact product page, or ad containing a product, or purchase has been associated with you in a database.  For example, maybe your parents purchased this product online. Now they and this product are connected in a database.  If you are their family member on Facebook, and your girlfriend is in a relationship with you on Facebook, then she is now a few degrees of separation from this product.  This might sound farfetched, but it's exactly how some product recommendation algorithms work, in an oversimplified nutshell.  It's all a bunch of relationships in a database, or many databases.  So all of the necessary relationships exist to explain why she recieved this ad without introducing conversation spying.

Again, not saying this isn't real, just that the video demonstration and anecdotes on this thread are certainly intriguing, but not sufficient evidence by themselves for me, especially after working under the hood for these as companies and seeing how much data they have from other sources.  But maybe.

Couple thoughts as someone who advertises on Facebook.  I believe Facebook will look for friends of people who meet the criteria to see if they like or search similar things.

Now maybe this coworker is also your friend on facebook, if they spike in interest for bow stuff, and you interact with them frequently, facebook might start sending you bow stuff simply because you might share this same interest. thus by knowing your location, and that this search term is rising in your area, they can predict ads around you and your social group without having to directly listen to you. Maybe they're accurate because you are in this region, or maybe its because you have this specific friend. Conversely maybe facebook decided people in your area were a good market for bows. They may be marketing all this bow stuff at you simply because of geography.

What comes to my mind is that they could be using the users friend base and sharing advertising between them. So a lot of people in this thread think for some reason after talking to a friend they receive out of the blue adverts about the topic they had discussed. Whats more likely is that their friend showed an interest in this product by looking it up and because they are friends and may have recently shown interest in each other on social media it crosses over the interest between them.

So I don't think its so much that its gotten good at reading one person in particular, I think the future of it will be cross referencing social groups for data, seeing who shows interest in who by measuring interest and even GPS locations, all things which are made very public. Understanding peoples wants and desires isn't really hidden in what they search for, its understanding their desires in the context of their life ...which is data that social media has. 

Cross referencing target advertising within social groups I think is what gives the sense that it listens to conversations. If I had to guess. But I don't know if they do it. Listening to actual conversations would be too much, if caught out they would suffer backlash. Cross referencing advertising isn't a headline that would receive backlash, people don't even care that they are farmed for data. "

rafertyjones,1509317225.0,2,"Check the patents and for acquisitions of small specific companies. In 2015 Facebook bought the voice recognition startup ""Wit.ai"". They have also filed a patent for a system of using camera footage of users to track emotional reaction without them being aware. They might not be recording everything but they certainly could be using fingerprinting to deliver targeted advertising without technically storing users' conversations. Facebook is just an advertising platform when viewed from the perspective of profits, would that mean that they would choose to monetise keywords from overheard conversations? I think that they have the capability and also the motive so it seems quite likely that this is used in one form or another.

They also undoubtedly pull information from messages and posts using natural language text processing. All these things, plus tracking through ""like buttons"" and cookies means that they have a huge amount of information already. It doesn't seem like much of a stretch to assume that they would exploit another source of information to make advertising even more specific.

 wit.ai was used to train bots to process natural language and speech recognition of natural language.

It isn't exactly a secret when they post the ""evidence"" on the wit.ai blog. There was even a quote from Facebook on techcrunch about using the speech data in various capacities:

“Wit.ai has built an incredible yet simple natural language processing API that has helped developers turn speech and text into actionable data,” Facebook tells me. “We’re excited to have them onboard.”

So they bought a start-up specialising in real-time speech recognition and natural language processing, said that it produces actionable data, and you think this is a conspiracy?"

No, she was the stalker, all over his page... Facebook clearly suggested her to him and because she is cute, he added her.

Also, brand recognition could play a factor in it.  What I mean by this is based on my own experiences, where I basically don't pay much attention to Facebook ads.  Like, almost no attention whatsoever and I've been on there for a long time so I'm guessing I've seen and dismissed a lot of ads because they weren't interesting.  There's been a few times the ads coincided with something I was trying to order on Amazon, which is pretty common from what I've heard.  The thing is that I noticed those items showing up only because I'd recently been thinking about them so they stuck out to me, but for all I know they'd been advertised multiple times in the past and I just ignored them.

Maybe it was listening in, maybe the ads were added because you'd been using internet at their location, or maybe you only noticed the ad because you'd been recently introduced to the brand.  Hopefully I'm explaining the idea correctly."

I don't opt-out of their services to an extent because I find the experience of using Google's products more practical and pleasant by signing into a common account, but I also don't use any of their voice controlled services and I'm comfortable handing over what I knowingly type into their websites.

If this is happening all the time, WHY are you not removing apps, changing phones etc? This whole thread screams of confirmation bias up the ass, everyone can remember ads that felt a bit weird. (like facebook giving me ads to match.com after I went single on facebook *duh*).

Like you're sitting here saying straight up ""they are listening to us"" and acting all butthurt and offended, but you're just taking it up the ass and not doing anything about it?

Like I'm not gonna say if they are or are not listening to people, but if they are, their ads algorithm is absolute shit, do you believe only some of the ads would be 100% correct if they could hear everything you said? like all of the times you discussed ""fuck yeah Im buying intel proccessor tomorrow or TV dat or monitor dis or car X etc"", why didnt it give you targeted ads then?

Not anymore. They updated it a few months ago to do a hybrid local and cloud based processing of the keyword, because they were getting slow and inaccurate readings from having multiple activation keywords (which is why google has stuck with 1 for so long), so Amazon now uses the cloud to also process the keyword.

https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/enable-cloud-based-wake-word-verification.html

Keep in mind that 'enabling it' is instructions for AVS developers creating software, NOT customers, its on and cant be turned off. And while it does show some reasonable examples like 'alex', legally they can now upload anything they want to try and they have a justifiable reason.

People should make their own choices on what ""bad"" things to consume, but they shouldn't be manipulated by emotional reactions like ""I'm lovin it"" with a nice storyline to buy something. 

Some form of advertisements are okay too. But as soon as they are tapping into our ingrain emotional responses, using psychological things that have developed over generations to convince us to buy things, this is an immoral behaviour and will continue to be a slippery slope. Even advertorials in the newspaper are framed like actual articles & fool a bunch of people into believing that these hyped up ""articles"" are up to the same standard as a news article.

An advertisement by coca cola to drink their soda is mostly manipulating the public into ""opening happiness"". It's teaching them an unhealthy behaviour, there is little to no benefit (maybe an ""enjoyable"" drink) to the behaviour, meanwhile Coca Cola makes millions/billions off of manipulating an emotional reaction of a person.

Manipulating people for your own gain is a psychopathic symptom. It's not okay on a human-to-human basis, but it's even less okay to influence someone 24/7 via advertisements made to target a human's weak points that will make them succumb to the advertisement. If you think advertising is okay, would you also agree that if I learned to put something in water to hypnotize people to send me money, that this too would be okay?

Eh, yes and no. I think Google understands this, too, so they try to be as transparent as possible through the UX they've carefully crafted, such as when you initially setup a new Android phone - it asks you the important bits. Even after that, installing apps will ask for permission for each and every thing.  

Hmm, now that I think about it, I wonder if the FB app *is* asking for mic permissions, but under the guise of video calling. You as the user expect it to be for that, but they also slip in the ad spy thing.... slick bastards if that's what they are doing. (Apps don't usually tell you *why* it needs access to X or Y unless you dive into their ToS, but it is there to throw red flags if say a calculator app asks for permission to access your contacts, for example.)"

Yes, our phones can text/email/call/etc. Yes, there are tons of apps that provide the same functionality that the FB messenger app provides.

But what makes Messenger much better to use is that it has the **least friction**. This means that Messenger provides very low amount of obstacles between between people communicating. 

The biggest obstacle Messenger eliminates is getting most of the people you know in the same platform. This is the biggest hurdle for any competitor and the main reason why everyone doesn't want to use other means of communication (such as what you listed) available on your phones. 

If I wanna use App X, a few of my friends may have app X but others might have app Y. So now I have to constantly switch between X and Y? Facebook Messenger helps eliminate that obstacle (in most cases) and reduces friction.  I don't need to remember my user/password or how to use 5 different apps. Not that using different apps is hard, but again - its all about the friction. 

The UI is not the best, but its simple and the app is feature-rich (Built-in camera, searchable GIFs, an Emjio store, voice messaging, calling, video chat, etc.) It has almost every feature you want in a app like that, why use 3 or 4 apps to try to get all these features when you can just have it one? Once again - reduced friction. 

Another way it eliminates friction - **you can talk from almost any platform and you RETAIN the same functionality as well as most of the features**. iPhone, Android, Facebook.com, Messenger.com, etc. 

Google was the last major competitor against facebook messenger, when Google Hangouts was at its peak. But then Google shot itself in the foot by release 5 different apps to solve the same problem, worst of all they were all disconnected so they flopped. They underestimated how hard it is to get people moving on their platform. No one wants to switch from hangouts to allo to duo or whatever. They just want one platform that works and that has all their friends.

Anything less then that is an anecdote that has the same value as me saying ""I have been a heavy Facebook user for a decade and have used the app on both Android and iOS, and have never experienced anything similar to this.""—which is to say, it counts for more than nothing, but it counts for very little.

The most biasing part of all of this is basically that: anyone who believes they've had this happen, or simply has an ax to grind will volunteer their own unsubstantiated story about how they've ~totally had this happen, but few people who have never experienced this bother to speak up.

They've got your phone constantly telling it's location via GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, sending an SMS etc. Someone else's phone doing the same. They have your conversations on Facebook. They have your purchase history via online accounts. Where you live, the Real Estate history of where you live. Who your agent is. Who you work with.

100% of this they can deduct based on ridiculously powerful algorithms linking you with other people, their search history with yours etc.

They're not dumb, all this data is hashed. They can't read it themselves. They don't need to.

That is very likely.  Much like when you buy a new car you suddenly see all these other cars out there which are exactly like yours.  Yet a few weeks prior you didn't even notice them.  It is all about familiarity.  

Hell I didn't even know all of the ads I was presented in my facebook feed until this story (and others like it) made me pay attention.  Then I realized how little facebook actually knows about me since the products and services they recommend are so far off from what I am actually interested in that it makes no sense.

Here is something else people forget - often our phones are near radios or televisions where they would be picking up other voices.  Would this be an effective way to market products?  Hell there are times I'm holding my phone in my hand and the person on the other end can't understand me - am I really supposed to believe it can pick up specific phrases as it sits on my counter in the next room?

I agree - their algorithms aren't nearly as efficient and accurate as many like to pretend they are.  "

So yea - we are probably very predictable."
Xynomite,1509313629.0,2,"The Volkswagen example is a good one, but even in that case they were eventually found out, suffered MASSIVE financial penalties, executives lost jobs, and there were criminal indictments.

If facebook was/is doing anything illegal there would need to be hundreds of their employees that would know about it.  That is a secret that would be hard to contain for very long because if just one of these people was having a bad day or didn't get the raise they wanted they could spill the beans to the press and the FBI.

I'm not saying it is impossible, but I would say it is highly unlikely.  The amount of data used by recording and transmitting conversations 24 hours a day would be significant enough that I feel it would be easy to recognize to anyone looking for it.  I suspect the real reason for targeted ads is much less villainous as some would like to believe."

It's a bit like the way the light next to the webcam is set up to go on to let the user know in case an app tries to do it sneakily. 

So in order for this to be possible either Apple would have to be in on it, or Facebook would need to be using some kind of exploit that bypasses the security features. However, either option would open up FB to so many legal issues I doubt they would consider it worth it. "

- I could easily spot and count words that were being said if they were defined in my dictionary. Sending the most listened words back to a server couldn’t be easier

I really don’t believe this tinfoil hat theory, but it would be totally possible for Facebook to slowly parse small sections of audio with minimal processing impact. They wouldn’t have to parse every single second of audio, but maybe just take the loudest part of every hour, or the part that looks most like clear speech on its waveform. You grab that part of audio, discard the rest and take the next hour to slowly process it. Rinse and repeat. "

Phones already do this on the fly. Speech-to-text has been a standard feature for years now. This is an OS component that any software can use. I wouldn't be surprised if Facebook simply uses this functionality to convert everything to text, then upload that to their servers. Then they just let their servers use sophisticated high-powered big data algorithms.

Also, it's no secret that the Facebook app uses significant resources while supposedly idle. Uninstalling the Facebook app from your phone has been objectively verified to increase phone battery lifespan anywhere from 15 to 20%."

MasterThalpian,1509346363.0,1,"Right but my point is that Facebook probably sends similar ads to people’s immediate social circles if they seem to be in roughly the same demographic. It probably knows that the two of you were in the same location and so are somewhat good friends (also taking from whatever your interactions are like on Facebook itself). So I’d imagine that you might have seen an increase of ads that it would normally send at this guy, but you don’t notice the ones that don’t fit. You only notice the one that happened to match something you talked about. Baader-Meinhoff and confirmation bias. 

Sure, I could be wrong, but Facebook has so much data on people without needing to constantly listen for keywords and phrases. It’s probably pretty scary what it can tell about you just from your online presence. 

Edit: I don’t ever look at Facebook ads but I just went through the first 20 or so sponsored ads on Facebook. Only one of them seemed like it was actually targeted at me. It was ExxonMobile. On Friday I googled and called a nearby Exxon gas station because my car needs an inspection. Another ad that feels somewhat relevant was one for migraines. One of my roommates gets migraines occasionally so it seems reasonable that he would have googled info on migraines at some point or Facebook knows that about him and sees that I use Facebook from the same IP address. The third interesting ad I saw was oddly specific: German embassy or something. This one was clear why I was seeing it. A recent friend that added me had also liked the page and so I was seeing their ad. We became Facebook friends a few weeks back and he recently added me to a group page that he runs. So Facebook likely assumes something there. The rest of the ads were all pretty irrelevant to me. "

I’ve never searched for any of that on my phone. I did look up on my laptop to see if the characters were historically accurate at all but that’s it. It’s been months and even when I tell Instagram I’m not interested in those posts I still see them. 

Oh and another example, even though I’ve never looked at Victorian outfits I’m seeing them all over my Instagram feeds because I shared an article about a modern woman who makes Victorian clothing.

lucky_rabbit_foot,1509316818.0,2,"This story and a lot of similar ones can be explained by location tracking.

The advertising networks knew your friend was seaching for thermostats. Maybe it was through Amazon or Google or some other site, but advertisers knew about it. Maybe they even know he bought it.

Now if they're tracking their location and your location and happen to see the locations match up, they know this dude has been searching for thermostats and there's a chance you've been talking to him. Maybe he was telling you about the thermostat. In that case, they can decide to target thermostat ads at you.

This also explains the Whiskey Ice Cube Death Star thing. The guy's parents searched for it and bought it from their house. The GF shows up at their house, the locations match up, she gets the ads.

I think my theory is a lot more plausible than apps constantly recording you. Also it could simply be coincidence. When a company starts a big ad campaign for something, lots of people buy it. Then they talk to other people, then those people start seeing those ads all over the place. See https://psmag.com/social-justice/theres-a-name-for-that-the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon-59670."
RelentlessUpvoter,1509317412.0,2,"Just a theory : you were in the same location as the people you talked to this about. They may well have searched for it after you talked to them. So your shared location being the link, right before the search, odds are you were talking about it just before. So they throw ads at you about something somebody around you searched for. With a bit of luck you look at it and think 'hey that's what he was talking about' and mention it to them. They manipulate you, by looking at the add you gain knowledge which you can then share for karma. Anyway here's my upvote. "

FB started creeping me out before the microphone business.
With the new political climate, I’ve become more civic minded and about 6 months ago I emailed my senator.

I got rid of the app and always stay logged out of it.

But...I had my mike enabled for Safari and everything else. About a month ago my best friend and I are talking about doggies and she says she mentions the company Chewy. My phone was on the table, nothing open. Of course the first ad that I see on a random website a couple of days later is Chewy.

I now have my microphone turned off of all apps including Safari. Always logged out of gmail. My work friends think I’m being crazy, that you can’t escape it, but I don’t care. 
I don’t want ads tailored to me. "
tasha4life,1509323193.0,1,"It’s google too. 

You can prove it by uninstalling Facebook keeping google chrome or their google app on your phone and then use Safari to search for something. 

When you use Safari, those search items do NOT show up on Facebook or anything else. Talk about camping. Watch how fast tent ads and Coleman stuff pops up. 

It doesn’t happen as fast as two days but it takes about a week. Just long enough for you to kind of forget where those inputs were. 

Personally, I think they are all doing it but of course Facebook is more aggressive and Google is smarter about it. The biggest tip off is that pic of Mark Zuckerberg with a piece of tape on his own phone’s camera. 

Why would he block the camera on his own phone unless he KNEW that it was able to record without his permission? He doesn’t want HIS personal life to be recorded because that would be HUGE NEWS. 

“Mark Zuckerberg reads reddit while taking a giant dump. He was also found to barely wash his hands afterwards and his toilet paper wasn’t even on the dispenser roll. It was sitting on TOP OF THE OLD EMPTY ROLL!?!!

“We can also ascertain that he might be going overboard with some sort of fatty red sauce diet due to his pinkish floater that we caught a glimpse of.

A few hours later I see an ad for flintstones gummy vitamins while causally browsing  on my phone.

Of course pretty much everything does some level of passive datamining that you aren't aware of, Facebook is just the most blatant.  At this point if you aren't running some kind of permissions/privacy manager on your phone (typically one that requires root) then you may as well just copy everything you type, say, or save to every single company you have an account with."

rigred,1509319851.0,4,"Privacy minded software developer here. This is exactly how this works: WiFi co-presence correlation. Facebook and Google etc have really accurate maps of wifi networks thanks to the app (facebook) and Google services logging and submitting the wifi SSID(name) & BSSID (mac address) as well as cell tower cellids around you. Some users also have GPS on. Once someone has had GPS on all the wireless networks around you can be precisely located to within about 50meters. Now if you even with GPS off go somewhere the software on your phone can still locate you to a very precise degree by submitting the mobile network cellid its currently connected to and the wifi networks it sees to a Google geolocation API. This then responds to you with a best guess as to your location based on all the previous data from everyone else's phones (also Google street view cars, they too log wifi networks). In this process Google or facebook or really any app with full wifi access is able to correlate which people are in close physical proximity.

femanonette,1509337777.0,1,"While I definitely do think 'smart' tech is being used to spy on us, I do think that most of what people think is evidence of that is due to what you're saying - shared wifi networks. 

I only say that because I *don't* see targeted ads on things that I openly speak about having interest in buying. Example: I've been looking into buying a Dyson. I have searched it, spoke about it, even made a post on facebook saying that I wanted one. Not one ad.

In addition to that, my ads are *very* random. I work in a hospital and connect to their network regularly. Their network doesn't have a password and it's what everyone in the hospital has access to; including patients. 

Not to mention, that I literally sell my interests to Google through their Rewards app. Even then, my ads aren't targeted and they *often* get my last whereabouts wrong when asking me if I've been to a list of stores recently.

Point being, this would also lend support to the shared wifi connections argument and less the 'they're listening to us!' one.

This on top of the fact that facebook has the ability to monitor the microphone, is already analyzing the data around the phone for music and TV, etc. It's too coincidental. All the evidence points to facebook's using this to target ads.

Obviously companies wouldn't pay for screen space on Facebook if nobody bought their products.  Hence FB *do* have incentive to make the ads more targeted by listening in.

* They we're not my friend on Facebook (or any social media) at the time and the context was of an moderately obscure (unpopular) video game.
* From what I understand this is an extremely small part of the game, just something she had noticed and made maybe a 3 minute aside conversation about. 
* The area we live in is not really where you would expect much to do with archery (big city, limited wildlife in and around).
* After it happened I told some friends and I think they would have mentioned if they had also seen such ads. I kinda doubt ""archery"" was trending among my area or my friends, but it is possible; this would mean the other items it suggested (like i said it's happened a handful of times) would also have to have similar circumstances, which is very coincidental.

The ad targeting would be so all over the place, it wouldn't make much sense at all. It would spread like a disease. The thing about targeted adds is they are supposed to get more specific, more personal, more targeted towards your personal needs and interest.

If another coworker uses that network to search for archery, or maybe she's been talking to lots of people and a few have googled it, they make the connection with everyone who regularly connects to that network.

It actually makes it a bit more scary in a way, how easy it would be to make these connections.

No, it had no idea about their mental disorder, it just noticed they both spent hours at a time, regularly, at the same doctor's office.

Probably the same thing here.  We know from your mom's shopping history that she's interested in X, and you spend a lot of time in the same location as her, so maybe you're interested in X too.   

So they're just tracking every site you go to, your shopping behavior, and your GPS location - not what you actually say.

nklim,1509315542.0,7,"Google and Facebook don't play nice in the marketing world, mostly because Facebook keeps all its data and tracking very close to the chest, so to speak.

Very few people understand how Facebook gets and processes its data.

That said, I'm skeptical of whether FB records users mostly due to the technical end of things, but some users here make compelling arguments into its feasibility.

Still, I think a lot of people would be surprised to realize how unique they *aren't*. Taking the bow and arrow example, Facebook uses something called a ""similar audience"" pool, which is based on demographic and interest data points of confirmed bow and arrow users, and shows those ads to someone who is, say 80 or 90% similar.

If Jim works in an office with Rick, and they are at least similar enough to chat once in awhile, it's pretty likely that they share a fairly large amount of data points. 

Facebook says, ""Hmm, Rick is a straight white 20-something male Android user who works as a data analyst at XCorp in Smithtown, and I *know* he likes bows and arrows, and Jim is a straight white 20-something male Android user who works as a data analyst at XCorp in Smithtown... I bet he likes bows and arrows too!""

Sickly_Diode,1509318652.0,2,"Facebook does send a lot of encrypted data between the app and their servers regardless though, it would absolutely be easy to hide additional data in that stream without anyone noticing. I'm not saying they necessarily are, but you'd have to break their encryption in order to determine what data they send. You could only make a rough judgement call on how much data they send otherwise.

Obviously they're very unlikely to be transmitting raw audio without anyone noticing, but there's no reason processing can't mostly be done locally or using highly compressed audio. It would lower their success rate, but it would also lower their chance of exposure. It all seems much further than even Facebook would go, but it would be possible."

Without knowing all the different ways these companies associate your data to you I would expect you'd have to use a lot of different set up information each time. New phone, new number, new account, new payment method, new internet connection, new location, new profile, new product each time. That might be a bit too much but I'd say it's the only way to control a potential identifier linking your data profile back to you.

However, this just seems nonsensical for so many reasons to me and there is just no proof that Facebook is doing this. Aside from that, the system would probably be super flawed and ""noisy"" in the sense that it's difficult to filter out all relevant data points offline. People talk too much all day, plus the phone might just be recording the radio or TV, then all of the sudden you would get advertisements for conversations that are not even relevant to you because you left your phone next to your TV for an hour (and don't tell me it's recognizing your personal voice and able to associate it with your personal preferences all offline without anyone noticing). And if the phone was recording all of this, you would just see it store this data somewhere and then discard it after a set period of time as you describe it.

Gmail sees your account no. and their ad services ties it to your phone. You then sign in to your smart TV with account 47326 and the app/OS ad services tie this device to that Netflix account too.

It’s absolutely an invasion of privacy and no doubt they’re monitoring more than we think they are. But I stand by my statement about recordings. There are *plenty* of other situations that explain your “Indian guys asking for porn” anecdote and none of them are your phone recording you 24/7.

It’s not difficult to prove that your phone isn’t recording you 24/7. Tomorrow morning turn on your microphone and leave it on for the whole day. Tell me how big that file is, and more importantly tell me what your percentage your battery is at at the end of the day. Then look at your data usage and tell me where that file is hidden. Compress it as much as you want, you’re not going to be able to fit it into your daily data usage. Use software to take out all the quiet times or run voice recognition just to get the important stuff, it’s still going to be too much data to send. 

Now instead, look at your internet history. Look at the videos you watched and the articles you read, what your friends and neighbors posted on social media, the posts you looked at on Reddit, anything that they get *just from you using the internet*. Literally everything you do online can be tracked and recorded as a data point, and It costs no extra battery power or data because you’re already using the internet for it. The point is, you already give them so much information *voluntarily* that recording your phone mic literally isn’t worth it. Even if audio data could be recorded, sent, and evaluated without your knowledge it still wouldn’t be worth it for them. 

You’re right to be paranoid about how your data is used, but you’re focusing on an aspect of it that isn’t an issue. "

It would generate a huge backlash (look at the huge press the Guardian article got when they wrongly accused WhatsApp’s end to end encryption model of having a fundamental weakness).

This is precisely why google couldn’t enable end to end encryption by default for its “Allo” messenger service due to their assistant feature, as obviously the google assistant has to be able to see the text of the message. This is also why Facebook are seemingly in no rush to provide end to end encryption by default on Messenger too. That WhatsApp has none of these issues is a large part of its appeal for many.

Given that law enforcement in most countries appear to hate WhatsApp’s end to end encryption, I’m inclined to believe it works as advertised, otherwise the police would just rely on court orders against Facebook for the unencrypted version of conversations.

It listens to everything, always waiting to hear the trigger word to activate the device. 

But it doesn't send any of what it listens to outside of your house, and it doesn't store it internally. It can hear you at all times, but it can't do anything with what it hears because it isn't using bandwidth to send the info to an external server for storage and it doesn't have a large enough memory to store anything locally. 

Once it hears it's trigger word, it then begins relaying what it hears with an external server which is the ""brains"" of the operation, the servers then evaluate what you said, tell echo what to respond, echo responds, and then it stops communicating with the server and patiently waits to hear the trigger again.

* It takes a really long time in an uncontrolled environment to actually recognize the song. Even in a quiet setting, it can take upwards of 30 to 40 seconds to figure it out. This is indicative of short, relatively computationally inexpensive calculations (probably FFTs) being performed locally. Google's online recognition is much, much faster.

Murgie,1509327969.0,1,">  you think the obesity epidemic would be happening at these rates if Coca Cola & McDonalds would be allowed to convince people to continually consume their items?

Yes. Absolutely. One thousand times, yes. 

The root of the obesity epidemic is the fact that our species has been programmed over the course of more than one hundred million years of evolution to derive a reward response from the consumption of energy dense food sources. Now is the first time that things like refined sugars have become freely available to the masses in such quantities, and a sharp increase in obesity rates is the obvious result. 

Laying the blame at the feet of something like advertising strikes me as more of a coping mechanism than anything else. Sure, it'd be *lovely* if such pervasive problems could be attributed to a singular cause that could be so easily dealt with, but that's just not the kind of world we live in.

I mean just look at this exact post. The video doesn't prove anything and yet reached the top of the front page. Imagine the recognition if someone could provide solid evidence for it. And it's not like it's particularly hard to find either if they were doing it. Several cases of software, even entire phone lineups from a company have been found to spy on their users without permission. And yet nothing has been found on Facebook when they've been around for longer and has one of the largest attack surfaces because of their user base. 

Honestly, I don't trust Facebook, they've done stuff almost as shady, even shadier in some ways, than snooping with a microphone. But all solid evidence really points to Facebook not doing what they are accused of doing in this thread and I hate that I'm in the position where I'm defending them"

From an engineering perspective, I know there are are many methods in which users can be associated with each other and grouped as friends and family.  If someone in the group searches for something expensive/interesting/unusual, I believe that marketers are blasting their friends with ads for that specific thing to generate conversation and suggestions.

My own experience went like this:

I'm eating lunch with my sis.  She receives a a call from a friend that their child was just diagnosed with a rare cancer; something  most people have never heard of.  The family didn't announce it on social media or anything; they just told a few close friends.  After sis tells me the grim details of the call she opens Facebook.  Halfway down the page is the first ad:  ""Advanced treatment options for Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma""

This wasn't some random cat food commercial; it called up the kid's diagnosis by name.  There's zero percent chance it was a random ad blasted to millions of people on facebook that had no need for it.  Quite simply, FB pushed the cancer treatment ad to friends and family of someone that had just been searching for info on that specific disease. 

My sis insisted that Facebook had been listening to her call and was furious.  However, the much simpler and logical answer is that it's just group marketing.  Think of how effective the response rate must be when 2-3 people tell that family about a cancer treatment center they heard about that specializes in thyroid cancers....

I don't even really have a problem with facebook doing it. I know facebook's adds are super invasive because I fuck with it constantly trying to make it advertise wierd shit to me. mainly, don't use anything connected to facebook for like 3 weeks, then find a single friend who you haven't spoken to in 5 years, and click on their profile once. suddenly you will get their life story on your feed. or open a message to a family member and type in ""can you give me recommendations for glitter.

I remember back in the day. Facebook was getting hammered for its mobile revenue. And Zuckerberg had this public appearance and he kept bringing the convo back to mobile.


Not long after splitting Messenger, a major tech wrote about it's diversification strategy. Which was, instead of having Facebook do everything average, it'd spin out a variety of specialized apps and future proof itself out of losing its cool factor. Thus they bought Whatsapp, IG, the VR company Oculus etc etc to cast a wide net on user install of the companies holdings. 


Machine learning and AI can easily pull together seemingly disparate data and pull together patterns that computer engineers aren't creative enough to imagine. 






Long story short, Google and Facebook don't need overt rudimentary tools to crudely record and store audio. Pattern recognition and and torrent of reams of data of all users across all it's platforms is all it needs. Yes even the ones that aren't controlled by Facebook but allow users to sign in through it's Facebook login. 


Having said that, it's still major league creepy that Google Home, Amazon's Alexa, and the always on Apple iPhone X have not so subtle strategies for setting us on a path for hyper consumption."

My guess is that since I don't have Privacy Badger installed on my phone, Facebook tracked me (a non-Facebook user) through the like buttons on Amazon, and sent out ads to Facebook users in my general area.  If I had a Facebook account, I'm sure it would be even easier to make that connection.  The same kind of thing could explain a lot of the stories in this thread.  No mic tapping necessary."

The next day while browsing facebook in my S4, an ad about came up some massage parlor offering ventosa and then I remember an article I read a few weeks prior to that that facebook indeed listens to conversations to target ads.

sassergaf,1509321657.0,10,"Yes. Agree Google may be THE culprit. All non-Apple phones are using Google's Android OS.  Google has access to everything from the Android OS including the microphone, and they just monetized the listening technology into a product called Google Assistant for use on non-Android devices. 
Google can aggregate that data with your search history. All that data can be aggregated with the Google Plus data, which is Google's own Facebook - a pervasive social media data vacuum.  

I refuse to use to google for search (use duck duck go). I tried like hell to cancel my google plus account and there is absolutely no way to do so. I only use Apple devices. 
 I surmise Google, Amazon and Facebook have 3rd party agreements with each other to share their data, or they all have 3rd party agreements with the digital marketing vendors who buy your data from them and sell to the others. 

Oh, plus Google owns YouTube and the Chrome browser too! Add data from those sources to the ones above and Google owns end to end access on the online landscape to vacuum data for marketing.

This thread prompted me to log into my FB account and disable ad block. I'm seeing ads for things I've never discussed, but which I know are points of interest to the FB friend who lives nearby: various fitness products and baby gifts. 

So my guess is it's using some sort of intelligent algorithm to match your location with friends and pull whatever they've been searching and suggest that to you. It's using my ex-coworker for me because she's the only one in the same city as I am, even though we never interact. 

Granted, I haven't confirmed with her whether she's been searching for these things. I also don't have FB installed on my phone, so it couldn't listen even if it wanted to. 

But I was fairly surprised that it wasn't using my cookies like every other ad on the internet. I've been shopping for cat toys, twinkle lights, shower heads, wool tights, etc. etc. -- none of those products showed up in FB. BUT they show up on other websites.

The only Android phones immune to that crap are the 1st party Google phones, such as the Google Pixel (or the Google Nexus line that came before it).

If they are, then they are a little harder to get rid of (it involves remounting your file system as read-write and a few other steps, and may not be ideal for most non-tech people).

Wallofwillow,1509338144.0,1,"The best thing to do in my opinion is to look for a phone that lets you unlock the bootloader. Then way you can install whatever you want on it. You could for example install LineageOS which is the open-source version of the Android. You get total software control over your entire phone that way, being able to wipe EVERYTHING off of it whenever you want. This is generally the case with Google and Motorola phones, but exceptions exist depending on how/from who you buy it for both so do your research. 

Unlocking the bootloader (provided your phone release version is able to) is stupid easy, but then actually flashing your phone with a different version of Android can be rather hard, so this isn't for the faint of heart. You do need actual experience with things like  installing Windows, Linux, etc.

Confirmation bias isn't just something that affects people who easily believe in conspiracy theories. In this case it might also not be the perfect term, since it doesn't cover that we remember noteworthy things (something extremely improbable happening) while forgetting the less-noteworthy ones.

If FB were doing it, the chance to get caught would be rather high: if they were sending the raw audio constantly, there would be heaps of suspicious traffic. If they were doing the processing locally, there would be heaps of suspicious code that could be found by reverse-engineering the app. That, combined with the high cost of getting caught, makes it rather unlikely IMHO."

The fact that it was the exact same thing makes me think that a product ID from the transaction got tied to your girlfriend somehow.

Even w/out FB relationships connecting your parents to her (or to her through you), there could be some other links like sharing wifi as someone else her suggested, or using each other's computers, or some link involving your phones.  Everything is connected, and really, all it takes is one connection for this sort of thing.  Given that you're in a relationship in reality, there's probably some artifact of that in the digital world.

Maybe I'm wrong though and the conspiracy is real.  Either way, interesting stuff.  Thanks for sharing.

If something in a video sparks you to search online while it is playing, and if automatically generated/manually added subtitles are present, the probabilities the textual information is used for relevancy are certainly extremely high. 

With the rise of Content ID and apps like Shazam that expanded to identifying TV shows and even the music that'll play in it, to now the Pixel 2 identifying songs automatically on standby, it is natural to believe it can enhance anyone's success rate in information gathering. 

As such, why not push for people to do so more since the users are self imposing rules that degrades their informational/consumer needs' fulfilling performances? Some won't notice, and will help A.I.s a lot, others absolutely want this and give everything over, allowing services to organize their world's information, while others will complain about poor search results/irrelevant ads they want to block the more private they are.

MeateaW,1509323638.0,6,"So; your phone has wifi on.

Google specifically uses wifi networks (and their uniqueness - name Mac address etc) as a method of efficiently (IE without using GPS) track your location.

If you ahve wifi enabled, then it would have detected that house you visited, you would have been there long enough for it to scan the existence of the network (establish your location) and it would also know that you didn't just walk past that house, because you didn't get each of the networks for each house down the length of the street.

Instead, you jumped in your car and drove away from that one specific house.

So, now we know google can identify which particular house you visited.

In that house, those people just googled ""This specific escape room"" lots.

Now; google puts 2 and 2 together, ""Here is a guy that visited his friends house (who own wifi network X), and then drove somewhere else.  People he visited in that house googled escape room heaps.""

This shit isn't listening to you; it is tracking your location.  It is invasive; just not *as* invasive.

Finally, if you want to prove it isn't recording you.  Try turning on your microphone app, just turn it on and record for an hour.

Your phone will get hotter in your pocket than normal.  Because recording something *and actually doing something with it* (like uploading it, or saving it to internal storage) is non-trivial.

fauxgnaws,1509317844.0,2,"All ads are targeted already.  Facebook knows they don't have a cat (no pictures with cats in them, no visits to cat sites with facebook trackers, no cats from other sources).

The cat food company runs ads just for people with cats, not everybody else.  They would have to have run an untargeted cat ad within a day.

It can also be based on other demographics- like, if Facebook knows you're white, there's a better chance you own a cat than if you're black. If you live in a major city, there's a better chance you own a cat than a dog. Certain age ranges are probably more prone to having cats than others, and certain relationship statuses too.

Facebook recently started giving me ads for luggage; I haven't searched for luggage, or talked about it as far as I can remember, but I don't think it's an outrageous thing for Facebook to suggest to me. I'm employed and I've been employed long enough that I statistically probably have some money saved up, and can take time off if I need to. I'm also young (energy to travel), have no kids (nothing to stop travel), and I live in a very blue city (left/liberal people are more prone to travel). It's not outrageous for Facebook to think I fit into the category of ""person who would travel."""

Remember all the times you've seen ads that blindly mirror keywords you've used without any sophistication whatsoever?  All evidence indicates that the methods they have of predicting behavior are not very effective.

A better alternative hypothesis is that this was coincidence -- cat food is a common enough product that an ad for it could have been shown by chance, and if the person didn't see ads for cat food they probably wouldn't have posted the video, or the video wouldn't have gone viral.  So there's some confirmation bias going on here."

BureMakutte,1509308958.0,33,"Won't run makes sense because it wants those permissions, but ""it won't work"" was very confusing because it could mean two different things here and I interpreted it as the app would still somehow get the permissions to active the microphone."
kumquat_juice,1509313074.0,1,Nope. Still works fine on my Android phone.
BrixSeven,1509313820.0,0,"On iOS apps only ask for permission to features when you try to us the part of the app that requires it. In this case, if the mic is off, I'd expect a prompt when trying to take a video. These prompts are presented by Apple. If an app wants to use the mic they need to call Apple's API, and Apple warns the user and asks what they want to do.

I'm not sure if it's still the case, but last time I used Android any time I tried to download something from the Play Store you had to agree to give up everything just to download the thing. The result of this was me not wanting to download anything. Being able to just not use certain features, and being prompted as you try to use them so you can connect the action to the request, is a much better model."
loudassplane,1509315606.0,7,"Sure Facebook's apps can't (if mic disabled) and don't (according to Facebook) but other apps that have microphone access might be utilizing the privilege and selling the data to Facebook or any other organization willing to pony up the cash.

faguzzi,1509312934.0,3,"Ah yes, there's a conspiracy afoot."
RobertAPetersen,1509322980.0,2,"On iOS that’s not how it works. Apps don’t request permissions at download time, only when they launch and then specifically try to use that feature.

If it’s not showing up in your Privacy settings in iOS, it’s because the app hasn’t tried to use it yet. To test, attempt something like recording a video within Facebook, or doing a Facebook live broadcast, at that point iOS should pop up the permission dialog telling you Facebook is asking for it.

DrMcClimateChange,1509335812.0,1,"You don't even need to connect. Facebook will push a Bluetooth handshake ping from your device to local other devices. Now the handshake will fail, but the device IDs for all the rejected handshakes is logged by the initiating device. Sent up to the server and cross referenced. 

Then verification can be derived when another device in the locality does its own independent timed handshake pings in the room. This data then goes up server side. Rinse and repeat. 

Facebook now knows everyone at the party without violating a single individuals privacy or terms of service. It doesn't need to breach a device because it is everywhere. It just needs to know which tendrils have bumped up against each other and a larger pattern is derived. 


That said, Facebook is totally using that mic with people when it can get away with it. Maybe it's an old loophole that never got closed. Or a thing that was explored in December, partially deployed then partially canceled. Maybe it's just straight up commercial overwatch. Who cares. It still looks exactly like Facebook scraping more data than they should. 

I *really* wish we had a big data expiration schedule in the US. After periods of time data anonymizes then is purged letting companies only retain results rather than the raw file indexes. No clue how to enforce the idea, but I think it's fair for consumers to now start expecting boundaries on the data used. If it can't be kept secure (it can't), then it can't be kept indefinitely. "

Having a theory and testing it out isn't naive, stating something you don't know is. Evidence shows ad companies take info from things outside searches, we here are just trying to find out where.

It depends on the implementation though whether or not the detection of the word amazon is done on the client side or the server side. Also, to a computer, there isn't much distinction between listening and recording. A microphone on your desk is ""listening"" if its plugged in, but if it's listening for a specific word, it's recording and comparing.

The comment for the code checkin would, in a scenario like this, not be specific. Instead it might read something innocuous like ""ads platform improvements"" or similar. It could go years without being picked up, just look at the Kracked bug or even Heartbleed - both examples of something that went unnoticed for years. 

This sort of thing happens all the time - someone pulled credentials for the commit tree of an application at my old job, and committed a change that allowed remote access by any machine. It only got picked up after a year or so, and the commit was commented as ""routine certificate handling updates"" or something along the same lines. Peer review isn't always enforced, because it costs money to implement.

Besides - you're counting on the developer(s) being morally upright, and (more importantly) morally similar to you and I.

You have lots of friends abroad, and so maybe you have mutual friends with one recommendation, or at least mutual interests. So maybe Facebook cast a wide net that you might know, or want to know, these other people in that country.

Or maybe I go to school and it starts recommending people on my class, despite no mutual friends , because we are near all the time.

It can get to the point where this technology seems like it's inside our own heads, like it's listening to our most private conversations. Because that's what it's *trying* to do.

2.) Any ads that seem to appear due to conversations that take place around the phone can be passed off as coincidence by those who choose to doubt. Any ads that seem to appear due to conversations that take place around the phone can be held up as proof.

Or just look up WiFi ""pineapples"" that can be setup to mimic open public WiFi hotspots, but act as a ""man in the middle"" attack or quietly log all your activity, including bank info.

GMaestrolo,1509321428.0,2,"If you're buying a leather belt that says ""Genuine Leather"" you're buying a shitty leather belt. ""Genuine Leather"" is actually a grade/quaility of leather, and it's pretty much bottom tier (unless you count ""blended and stuck together with glue"" as a grade of leather, in which case ""genuine"" is the second shittiest grade).

If you want a leather belt that lasts long enough to hand down to your grandchildren, you'll want full grain or top grain leather. Expect to pay $80-$200 for a belt.

Basically full grain has the actual tough outer layer of skin, plus some of the softer under layer, top grain is the same, but the tough layer is thinner, because it's been sanded down/finished, Genuine and Suede are pretty much just the lower, softer stuff, but genuine has been made to look like top leather (polished, maybe given a fake grain, etc.). If that doesn't make sense, [maybe this image will](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRkgLgHvqRjz5o4ztVONjG3_tObs0efOB4Mlx9CwN6TwzY6640WvA).

And apparently you can't uninstall it.

I got a new phone a couple days ago and this got me looking for the app. I haven't used FB in years, but sure enough it and the messenger app are already installed. So I went to uninstall just now and I am not allowed to. I can only ""disable"" it. 

Why else would they insist on it staying on the phone if they weren't using it for something?

nklim,1509337568.0,1,"No. Notice that there is not a single shred of proof in this thread, including the original video.

Advertisers are *really* good at targeting ads to people, because no single person is as unique as they think. Maybe the pros who spend the most money on belts are men in their 30s. Maybe someone else on your network is searching for belts. Maybe you FB messaged someone about a belt. Maybe you bought new jeans so you might need a belt to go with it. Maybe it's just confirmation bias.

There are a million-and-one reasons that someone might notice an ad for a belt not long after discussing a belt. Until someone can provide irrefutable evidence in a controlled setting, I see no reason to believe FB is illegally using your mic, because it's just not a practical given the current state of technology, and frankly not  necessary given the thousands of other data points people willingly give away."
embracing_insanity,1509322929.0,2,"Same here. I think the belt one is just coincidence, but I've seen the videos and read many accounts of the FB Ads after talking about things while having their phone near.

Learning how to flash a new OS after unlocking the bootloader isn't easy, but once you learn it the process applies to every phone as it's just installing an OS like you would install Windows on your PC. Rooting on the other hand is an unofficial vulnerability jailbreak and will completely vary from phone to phone, and rooting has limitations itself.

Phone releases that let you routinely root your phone (as far as I know) are Google and Motorola. I'm not aware of any others, though they may exist. Do keep in mind that exceptions exist even for these two brands. For example I'm aware of Verizon releases of Motorola phones that DO NOT let you unlock the bootloader.

Termy56,1509318624.0,10,"I've been a software engineer for 18 years. And I've been a fly on the wall in enough executive leadership meetings to know 3 things. 

1. There is no free lunch in life. If someone is offering you something, its because they think in the long run it will be a good gamble. That's all it is, capitalism gambling that invested money will return more money. 
2. As a society, the ""entitlement"" society, we have started expecting things to be free. But look at #1, so everything that is free is actually just a contract with the devil. If you beat it, you win, but usually the house wins. 
3. Since any company that didn't offer you free stuff would lose out on business, now everyone offers free/discounted stuff; but only with contracts, or ways where over the long run its more expensive than just paying the full price. Its bate and switch. 

So...corporations are not inherently evil, but they have to show/turn a profit. Google was one of the first to realize that if they gave away all of their products, and created world class products, they could then mine their users for all sorts of information; and instead of charging the customer, they charged other businesses for the honor of really good leads and target conversion. Once Google showed it could work, Amazon, and Target, and, and...realized that the services they offer as free can be a treasure trove of information. 

Your calls, your texts, your emails, are all mined for information other businesses find interesting. 

Targeted advertising has become a science. Your age group, your religion, your previous buying habits, your conversations and other things above as mentioned, your area code, all the things that make you you, are mined to increase profitability. 

You get free services; and in return you've given up your privacy. 

Seems a long time ago Americans decided free with strings was better than paid and honest. Why? Because consumer spending drives these trends. They wouldn't do it if it didn't work as a business model. 

A great example I like to use is Target. Using Machine Learning, they realized that based on specific buying patterns of customers in stores, they could reasonably deduce that the person was pregnant. Pre-Natal vitamins, a shift in personal hygiene usage, and of course purchasing books on how to be a great mother for example. Then they sent coupons in the mail targeting products for expectant mothers. The program was a huge success in boosting sales of said products. That is until the father of an underage girl started getting these. He put two and two together, and that's how he found out his daughter was pregnant. Huge firestorm. They didn't stop doing it, but they inter-mingled the coupons with others that are non related, to make it seem like it was random. 

But back in the day Target kept their data, Google kept theirs, Amazon kept theirs...these days, you have data brokers who buy all available data from public sources, as well as private sources. So now all the things you do, across all the services you use, can be mined. Let that sink in. Everything about you is an open book. 

Sure...there are so called safe guards. Things like ""anonymous"" data...but given enough data, and enough time/processing powers, eventually you can put two and two together. 

That is our future and present. And everyone is finally waking up to rule number 1 in business...there is no free lunch."
sonofaresiii,1509313759.0,5,"It's definitely Facebook's *fault*, but I question whether there's anything nefarious going on.

If they have the microphone running and pick up keywords when it's not supposed to be listening, that's nefarious.

If they have an advanced algorithm that factors in things people wouldn't consider, then I wouldn't say that's so nefarious. (though many would disagree, and that's fine)

I used to pretty adamantly believe there was no way facebook was using the microphone to eavesdrops. After seeing so many people's experiences, I'm *less* adamant about it and have started to legitimately wonder if it's a possibility, though I still find it more likely people just aren't considering the ways facebook may be collecting data.

I also think it's possible people just notice the coincidences and ignore the random ads that aren't relevant. Everyone does seem to have a different time frame on when facebook implements its listening data-- some people say a few hours, some say a few days, etc.

Until I run my own tests, or someone manages to prove the microphone is running for facebook, or facebook explains how they make their predictions, I'm not making up my mind one way or the other.

Mostly, I find it unlikely facebook would be able to run the microphone steadily without killing the battery. Also I don't recall, does the facebook app request microphone permission? Unless there's something I *really* don't understand, the facebook app would literally not be able to run the microphone without permission (the messenger app probably does for video calls, but i don't think the regular app does)"

Gitnerd,1509352115.0,2,"The accuracy of this tracking must be absolutely world class. In apartment buildings where there are hundreds of 2.4/5 signals, my phone would be able to discern exactly which apartment I'm knocking on the door of? Or at town-homes all in a row, which door I'm knocking on there. Or even in our suburban sub-divisions, these homes are decently close together, definitely enough to be catching ssid's from all over the neighborhood. As a delivery driver, I used GPS navigation on a daily basis. Mostly google maps. Their location tracking is pretty spectacular, it would know which side of the street I'm on, but it would only be able to tell which exact house I was at if it was a bigger house with a bigger lawn. I mean this is a college town not a lot of people live in nice family houses with a property underneath it. Over 50% of my deliveries are to complexes where people live in units (apartments, business buildings, duplex neighborhoods, quadplex neighborhoods, townhomes, studios, hotels, motels, etc etc). 

Furthermore, history.google.com exists. It proves that your phone does upload voice of you, not only records it but then uploads it. [Here's a picture of my history.google.com](https://i.imgur.com/Wj6bSgk.jpg) - Recently, my phone uploaded a voice clip of me on the 27th and 28th of this month. Just about 2-3 days ago. Google doesn't give you the option to download these voice clips, but [I'll use FL Studio 12 to record my system sounds, and simply click play so that we can have an audio clip of our own.](https://clyp.it/u4abjqsu) And looky there, the phone was clearly recording me before I said the words ""Ok Google"". The only way this must be possible is if it is recording all the time, and then cuts it's recordings into clips and uploads the most important bits. Sometimes these audio clips are cut correctly, and the recording begins right when I say ""Ok Google"", but that is just because the automatic clipping did it's job well, not necessarily that it wasn't recording before hand. Every now and then the autoclipper doesn't do as great a job, and we can get several seconds of audio (usually idle chat, driving in a car, moving around in a pocket) before a person says the keyphrase. Again, the only way, the only way that would be possible at all would be if the phone was actively recording you before you needed it to.

ultio,1509314777.0,3,"Well, the research project I did was kind of similar to this except it used images, however, it can easily be applied to audio as well. You just create a ""template"" that represents a word using a trained neural network for a list of specified keywords. You then store these templates on the phone and then let it periodically parse the recorded sound and see if it matches any of the stored sound templates. If it's a strong match, you can assume that a certain word was said. 

If you limit this list of words to certain keywords that are important to advertisers, the performance would not be that bad, though performance degrades as the list of keywords grows, so you would likely assign certain keywords to certain user groups to keep the list of words as small as possible for each phone. If a keyword is matched repeatedly, the app could request an advertisement of said keyword group later on.

However, like I said, I know this is relatively easily possible with today's technology, but I don't believe this is happening, it still requires too much performance to do this real-time as far as I know because you have to create templates for each spoken word in real-time on the phone.

Who knows what the technical limitations of the permissions system is on iOS devices. Companies have played around the edges of it for a while. But if Facebook were to be listening ALL THE TIME to conversations, and then turning that into ad targeting, I guarantee you: Apple would be furious, probably close them out of the App Store for at least a probationary/review period, and Facebook would see class-action suits for privacy violations the likes of which they have never seen. It would be a losing gamble for Facebook.

I think you're maybe overstating what can be done w/ basic voice recognition software.

If the belt wasn't black, did you still wear it on your wedding day, and if so, did you plan the color of your attire to match the belt?

Every time I buy a new pair of dress shoes (except black) I get a belt of the matching color of leather from the same manufacturer. I can use the same polish to keep everything matching perfectly and looking very sharp. In my experience, Allen Edmonds makes a very high quality belt in addition to quality shoes.

nstarleather,1509361085.0,1,"That ""leather grading"" thing is the biggest Leather Myth on the net (especially Reddit)!

""Genuine"" is not nor has it ever been a grade or specific quality of leather, in fact, not too many years ago it did get stamped on lots of quality stuff.   With time, importers stamped it on cheap good and ""ruined"" the term for those of us who work with leather...in fact if you find something vintage with a ""genuine leather"" stamp, chances are that it's really good quality. 

Saying that ""genuine leather"" is something specific (a grade of leather) is like saying ""100% beef"" refers to a specific cut of steak. 

The genuine=bad is a spin put out by a specific company (Saddleback leather whom you've linked to), in an article some years ago that got copied and pasted and repeated everywhere.
BTW that 100-year warranty is only for *defects in workmanship or materials*...as in problems that were present when you bought the item, not wear and tear, no belt will last anyone 100 years.


I've kind of made it my mission to try to fix this misinformation.
Here's the TLDR:


Genuine just means Real, that's it. The leather the articles call ""Genuine"" is called a ""finished split"".

Top Grain: Just means the ""not suede"" part of leather, usually means something (embossing or sanding) has been done to the surface. Can still be a great leather. The amount shown to be taken off in that graphic is not to scale, the amount taken off the top is usually 1/10th's of a millimeter. 


Full Grain means nothing has been done to alter the outer grain, but you can still cover it with a heavy coat of finish and it will look ""less natural"". It also can vary greatly in quality. ""Full grain also can vary greatly in quality and cost. ""Bad"" full grain exists and is becoming more common. Full Grain from Leader Tannery in Pakistan will set you back just over $2 per foot while Horween is around $7.35 even when you’re buying 1000 feet at a time.  BTW full grain like Chromexcel and Top Grain like Cavalier from Horween are priced roughly the same.

The actual term “leather grades” refers not to the quality of leather itself but to individual hides, as in how much of the hide is usable due to scars, scratches, brands etc...but even then it varies, some tanneries use “A,B,C” others “I,II,III” or “1,2,3”

cultural_dissenter,1509325819.0,44,"Google bought DoubleClick.

DoubleClick has ""retargeting"" technology, which looks at where you have been in the past to serve ads in the future.  It's most commonly used to serve ads for products you've already looked at.

Facebook partnered with Google to get access to that system.

https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/18/doubleclick-fbx/

The system works better the more data they have, so they share profiles.

Facebook, meanwhile, acquired LiveRail.  LiveRail is an ad marketplace technology that is designed to let companies run private exchanges.  So, you sell ads on your site, then you pimp out those ads to other sites for money.  Meanwhile, if you don't have an expensive ad, you let other sites with their marketplace sell ads on your site.

Hulu has a ""private"" ad exchange, that's powered by ... LiveRail.

http://adage.com/article/digital/hulu-facebook-liverail-oracle-ad-tech-sell-ads/300080/

So, when Hulu doesn't have an ad of their own to show, they go out to the private marketplace - Facebook's marketplace.  Facebook exchanges data and ad space with Google.  Google has an extensive profile on you, so those ads pay better than untargeted ads, so they show up first and most often."

Thatwhichiscaesars,1509316851.0,5,"Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that it couldn't happen, im just saying there are other logical possibilities for many of these situations. In your specific situation id err more on the idea that it was based on your connection with your wife  more than it was based on your location.

-------------------------

Now im not saying that this is what happened, but lets ask ourselves ""how else could google know?"" So,  your wife had been vatican city years before, right? Well, maybe in the days leading up to your conversation she was feeling nostalgic, and so she started searching for stuff about Vatican city on her phone/pc. You know to spark some old memories, I do this all the time. Maybe she was getting ads already and that inspired her to search, or maybe she only got them after she started searching, it doesnt really matter so long as she's searching.

By this point she's probably set off some ad based alarms. Google will likely start giving her ads for stuff like ""vatican city vacation planning,"" if it wasn't already doing this. Tailoring based on search terms is nothing too ground breaking.  but this would be for your wife, so how does it tie back to you? 

I would suggest that its because you are her husband. You two are connected, not just geographically, but through facebook, or google, and other social media.  In fact, facebook/google probably have enough information through to deduce that you are married. Knowing only that your wife is searching vatican city stuff, and that she is your wife, google could easily decide to start sending you tailored ads/search results for the Vatican city simply because your wife expressed interest. 

Now, why would they do this? Well, I mean vacations are a big deal, it makes sense that if you advertise at the wife you advertise at the husband, right? Its also intuitive to tailor results based on the searches of a spouse because,  what they search for and talk about could precipitate into what you yourself will search for and talk about. In this way google can give you personalized results that get you to the answer you want, faster.

but that doesn't solve the issue of timing, right? why did it occur right after your conversation? i dont know, but remember, often look for patterns in behavior, and its easy to conclude that you only got the ads after the conversation, but maybe you'd been getting the ads for a while, and you just never made a mental note of them because you weren't thinking about Vatican city when they popped up. after the conversation with your wife,  vatican city was on your mind and you were much more likely to consciously recognize the ads, where before you may have forgotten them. Theres a fun term for this, but i cant remember what its called, but its basically learn about something and then start seeing it everywhere. moreover, theres human error, I cant remember every ad i get, or search recommendation, thats for sure. i only remember the ones that stand out. Maybe the timing wasn't coincidental at all, and instead it was merely the first time you noticed an otherwise common occurrence. food for thought.

--------------------------------------

tl;dr

Once again this is just speculation, i don't have the wherewithal to say conclusively if it is or isnt monitoring conversation. instead im just positing an alternative explanation.

The next time it happens i'd suggest using google analytics and narrowing it by time and location. See if the term you got recommended spiked in popularity in your area, if it seems completely unchanged, and low volume, at the very least we can probably conclude it wasnt spiked by location."

Thatwhichiscaesars,1509319253.0,7,">weird ass random shit 

Like i said, im not saying listening to your conversations does or it doesn't happen ( i wouldn't be surprised if it did listen.) Instead what im suggesting is that there could be another explanation. For example: maybe that ""weird ass random shit"" you were talking about wasnt as weird or as random as you think it is. 

Maybe you and your girlfriend will be talking, and she saw some late night tv show, a popular one, about big bird. Something innocuous. As such the idea of big bird is still in her recent memory and she may be thinking about it. So somehow your the conversation get steered towards big bird, maybe because its on her mind and she really wants to talk about it. If something is fresh in your memory, your probably more likely to jump to it as something to talk about when something in the conversation reminds you of it, or relates to it, or when you simply have nothing else to talk about.

So you're on the conversation about big bird that seems random to you because she saw this show that got her thinking about it, and you didnt. What are the odds that she was the only person to see the show? unlikely. What are the odds that those other people had a similar question as the one you did, and started searching? I don't know, but I would wager its more likely than you think.

In this way the demographics for the show probably cross over with the demographics of the search terms. so if everyone in your demographic is thinking about big bird because of this show, your more likely to get big bird in your search results. 

I mean, in this age of statistics we often find our conversations arent as unique or as unpredictable as we perceive them to be. Assuming that your conversation is completely unique and  unpredictable then maybe the only way to know what was discussed was by listening to it... maybe. But maybe it wasnt unpredictable. I don't know, its not my conversation, its not my expertise, I cant say for certain what you were talking about or why, or how you got ads for it. Im just trying to give you an alternative explanation."

MeateaW,1509361696.0,1,"They only save and upload the recording when you say the phrase word, or it thinks you say the phrase words.

I don't understand why you think your evidence is proof against that.

I said they don't record everything, and don't upload everything;

I didn't say they weren't listening.  (I mean how could they not be listening and still respond when you say ""OK google"").

Could they upload some things that don't include the phrase word by accident? absolutely! the system thought you said it; then uploaded it; and it didn't find the key phrase, and like a good company kept it to show you what they did.

But I never claimed they weren't listening; I claimed they weren't saving and uploading everything you said. Because they don't.  They also aren't transscribing everything; because you rphone would be red hot all day if they were attempting to transscribe everything you said in their proximity.  The special low power chips they use to pattern match the ""ok google"" phrase is specifically designed to match a very small dictionary of words.  If you want proof; just turn on your microphone recorder and leave it running for a couple hours and tell me how your battery life goes.

(Edit: I'd like to insert here, that the recording used for pattern matching saves the data temporarily in RAM, which is not written to disk and probably remains in an uncompressed easy to use form)

Saving the data locally on device is a hell of a lot easier than on-chip real time transcription, but even that task would utterly demolish your battery life if it was doing it for every conversation (and tv show, and train trip, and car ride or whatever) it overheard that was above its ""ignore this"" volume threshold.

With respect to the wifi? You are damned right they have some great data.  They are google, they also include the signal strength of all the wifi networks around you.  Did you know, with just signal strength information you can basically pinpoint someones location down to an error of only a couple meters (it is so ""bad"" because of wifi signal reflection). Either way, easily enough to know which apartment you are in.

And your comment about hundreds of wifi signals?  That only increases the accuracy.  More data points mean higher levels of certainty about your location.  And to answer your other comment, yes, the system is world class. It is googles wifi location system, *it is world class*.  (mostly because they have such a large database of location points - them having the largest mobile phone operating system on the planet and all).

I'm not sure you know this, but do you remember when google got hit with the massive fine in the EU for trawling wifi data?  That is because when they drove their street-view cars everywhere they were recording all the wifi networks they drove past.  Is there streetview most places you travel?  Guess what, google knows exactly every wifi in range of a street view car and have a VERY good idea where they are in the real world.  And that ignores the people that live in that house and have uploaded that data every day of their lives that they are in range of the wifi access points in their area.

I'm not claiming google is good for your privacy, but you haven't proven they are recording your conversations and sending them upstairs, they honestly don't need to.  (and you'd notice it with your battery life if they were!)"

In two-party states, everyone involved needs to be aware of the recording.

The main reason that Facebook likely wouldn't do this would be the risk of recording other people's conversations.  They haven't agreed to anything, aren't subject to arbitration laws, and recording their conversations without consent is illegal.

You could maybe push that by doing like Google is doing with music recognition.  Push some signatures to the phone itself, and if there's a hit, say there was a hit.

How do I keep in contact with dear friends who have nothing and refuse to get anything other than Facebook. Further still I am expected to contact those people though these services, you cannot just show up at people's doors(not that a bad thing).

Have you ever tried a reasonable job search without google facebook linkedin or a mobile device. If you go into a business with your resume they will turn you away and tell you to apply on line. 

The network effect and social expectations makes leaving difficult for the vast majorities of people, espessially those who require it for work. 

What you are essentially saying is not dissimilar to telling a person stuck in an abusive relationship""you could just leave"", when they are crying out for help to do so. 

That being said I see No real way out. Even if you uninstall Facebook, they know about you from your friends and other stuff. The difficulty of going full ghost, and still maintaining business and social relationships, and keeping up to date with current events is ridiculous (I have tried to leave several times, but social nessessity has required I not, which is the most violating, abusive and inappropriate feeling when deciding to use a service). You can't practically live in the modern day without any of the free services which spy on you, not to mention the American government

rEvolutionTU,1509329224.0,3,"Maybe this is a bit too deep into this chain to get a proper answer, but don't we need to know how ""message"" is legally defined to judge this appropriately?

What I'm seeing here is that WhatsApp promises to protect the message. 

In comparison if I dictate a letter to someone for example, said person writes my message down, puts it into an envelope and brings it to the postal office they can for example both not tamper with the *actual message* in any way, shape, or form while still informing someone else of the content of the message. Them promising me to ""not look at or tamper with my message"" for example is completely pointless in this case.

I would not be surprised in the slightest if *my message* is something separate from *the data I input that later turns into the message*.

Not sure if my inner rule-lawyer is too paranoid here, I never really thought about this specifically until now.

Sniffing the data implies getting the content. I do this for a living. I can tell you, ""it's encrypted"" doesn't mean much. If your phone is sending data back, if you have complete access to your phone (if you root it), you can get it to send data to your fiddler unencrypted. And if your phone is receiving data, it must use that data, so it must be decrypted. Easily can see that too.

Encryption only matters over the wire, you can't man in the middle it. But if you control one of the access points, you're not a man in the middle, now are you? You're an end man. End man is awesome man. Sorry for the crazy rambling of a mad man."

Normally the phone wouldnt trust the homemade facebook server since it doesnt have a a valid root certificate, but if you have root access to the phone you can just ad your own root certificates to the phone, so it thinks your server facebook certificate was issued by a valid root certificate holder.

They know who your are, your name, your job, your age, where you should be at what times. They don't need the voice tracking. By linking all this meta data they know exactly who you are, what you are interested in. I work in data science too. I know this can be done. And I'am damn sure they do it.

A theory of how this might work would be that the app records with very low quality to keep size to a minimum and only record after the gyrometer detects that the phone is in the users hand or by other means of detecting that there might be a human in proximity. Facebook also takes ""targeted advertising"" very serious. This isn't television ads that need to appeal to a broad range of people, this is **your** feed and you are the only one looking at it, that's why almost all ads are perfectly selected just for you.

heseov,1509326296.0,1,"Ugh...you still are not understanding. How do you think they can identify a ""hard coded phrase""? Each ""hard-coded phrase"" is basically a ""dna"" for a word. This ""dna"" is generated in the same way as if you said the word out loud. So when you say a word, your phone converts into into ""01011"" based on an algorithm. They have a bunch of these preinstalled on your phone. You sometimes even train your phone. 
Anyways, It converts all the words it hears using this algorithm. Once it matches once of the words its converted to one it has preinstalled then it sends it to the servers. This is how the keyword detection works. But you could also just leave this feature constantly send any unique words and you have yourself spyware. I find it more likely its done by a smaller company and sold to the big guys."
cmatechno,1509323170.0,1,"Listen dumbass, do you know how voice recognition works?  Are you so retarded to think that the processing is done at server level?  You REALLY don't understand technology.  One thing is to deal with certain AI frameworks such as Siri or Bixbi or Google, and another very different is to deal with simple voice recognition that is done at a device level.  I'm not saying that FB is actively listening to everyone's conversation.  What is most likely happening is it is picking up audio at certain intervals (not to kill the battery among other things), and that audio is processed locally to determine if there are any significant keywords (most common non-noun words such as ""the"" are discarded for obvious reasons) and those keywords are then sent back to the server.
As to the zero proof, do you think FB is going to be so dumb to send plaintext back to the server? Most likely they are heavily obscuring the data sent back to the server, and there are many ways of doing that, f50c51ed2315dcf3fa88181cf033f8029cac64f7dea4048327ca032ec102ea74.  
As to doing that to a billion people, I can assure they aren't.  FB doesn't give a shit about people, they give a shit about profit.  So any particular segments of the market that they may be interested in is game for keyword extraction.  
By the way, get your terms correct: ""text to speech"" is actually something completely different from what we're talking here.  We are talking about speech recognition, not text to speech. 
I don't have a tin foil hat.  You, on the other hand, Mr. Know-it-all, seem to be completely gullible and I'm sure you don't give a second thought to anything.
In your extensive ignorance about things, you probably assume that encrypted WiFi is secure, you probably assume that SSL makes your transaction completely secure, and you seem to think that companies such as FB have a good heart.
Get your head out of your ass and stop being such a snowflake.

heseov,1509325636.0,1,"I honestly do not think its facebook. I think its the 100's of other data collecting companies out there. This is a huge industry now.

Every phone & device manufacture, isp, etc are working with one or more of these data collection companies to improve their margin on cheap devices & services. 

99% of people do not watch for these kinds of things. The only way they will know is if people like this youtuber help expose whats happening. You have to have someone notice and take up the cause before anything is found. This is the first step of progress if it because a problem. We have the technology and no rules, so it will have to happen eventually, right?

You claim this is not happening because their is no evidence, yet the evidence is presented in-front of you and you choose to ignore it.

buge,1509326755.0,2,"I did. In fact here's a quote from it:

>>It’s just a random ad and the advertiser/ad network was just super lucky to show you this product.

>Yes, I don’t exclude this option. I would love this to be true.

Even he says there's a chance it's just random. In fact he looked over the fact that it likely isn't random, just good targeting. For example he might be an avid bluetooth user (he specifically thought of a bluetooth projector so that seems likely). And he might be an avid photographer (also likely since he wants to share his pictures with friends). Facebook then might have figured out that previously people who are both avid bluetooth users and avid photographers were interested in this bluetooth projector. So  Facebook showed an ad for the bluetooth projector to him.

The scientific method I suggested would solve the problem of confusion with random or targeted ads. Having 2 groups: study and control would distinguish between random lucky ads and listening ads. And having which products are put in each group be a random choice would distinguish between targeted ads and listening ads, because since the choice of group is random, both groups are as likely to target you."

rebeltrillionaire,1509322743.0,4,"Yeah, I actually wrote my thought and then researched it a bit. Looks like the code isn't hard whatsoever. However, the companies have specific policies in place that don't allow this, AND have categorically denied using ""utterances"" to serve ads. 

With tech a lot of time what's possible is actually easily within reach, however the business model doesn't support it. If Facebook is always listening, then they become responsible for the data they capture. If they have terrorist plots or suicide talk they may have some culpability for having the data but not acting on it, and some lawyer would love to get rich trying that shit out in court. 

Or they don't want the PR hit that listening would have over the minor increase in profits from conversations. 

Or they simply don't believe in the crazy invasion of privacy that listening to people without their consent or knowledge would provide. That's optimistic, sure but it wouldn't surprise me if the leaders at these companies have refused any adoption based on that. "

> Researchers at MIT, Microsoft and Adobe have developed a way to turn regular objects into visual microphones. They have re-created audio from silent video recordings by analyzing the subtle movements of a leaf or empty Coke can that are created by soundwaves traveling through the air.

MIT article: http://news.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804

> Reconstructing audio from video requires that the frequency of the video samples — the number of frames of video captured per second — be higher than the frequency of the audio signal. In some of their experiments, the researchers used a high-speed camera that captured 2,000 to 6,000 frames per second. That’s much faster than the 60 frames per second possible with some smartphones, but well below the frame rates of the best commercial high-speed cameras, which can top 100,000 frames per second.

So please tell me about all these phones that can shoot video at 2000 to 6000 frames per second."

I was like.  What the fuck?! No bluetooth, no password sharing, nothing. It was just on my wifi streaming right away. I spent weeks trying to figure out how it did this. I had theories, but the reality is way fucking scarier than what I ever could have imagined....

Google Chromecast actually hijacks the speakers of your TV and has a micro-microphone inside it. Your phone already has a mic and speaker. What happens is both systems work in tandem establishing an encrypted communication channel using inaudible ultrasonic audio chirps to exchange your password through the air - [source](https://gizmodo.com/chromecast-now-pairs-with-phones-using-simple-ultrasoni-1596874145)

So by extension, any app can be talking, through the air, to any other phone that has the same app (or even just other apps which agree to share). Our phones can literally be talking to each other all the time. 

Now ask yourself this interesting question: Why would Facebook or Google or Apple or ANY other company choose NOT to do this? There is basically the potential for (if it isn't already there) an entire adhoc network which is not governed by FCC, which is not traceable.

Now, imagine you don't give Facebook permission to upload your data using wifi or the cell network. It doesn't matter now because it can just chirp that information to your neighbor as you walk past him in the front with a casual innocuous ""hello"" wave. His phone is chirping back to you the links to targeted ads you should be seeing and simultaneously selling your whereabouts to the FBI CIA and NSA. You don't even need a sim card or internet to be tracked now. 

This tech doesn't even need a phone. If you have a fitbit, it could fit in there. It would work in an mp3 player, your laptop, your clock radio, your car, your headphones... If it can fit a microcontroller & a speaker & a mic, it can be live on this network. That is tech which can balance on your fingertip and costs under 10$ and more than pays for itself.

That's not the future, that is now.

They can easily parse an audio file and convert it to words which are them easy to search and catalog. If the audio file was kept raw they'd have to parse every file every time they wanted to do something with it. The only reason I could ever see keeping the raw audio is you verify that the parser is working perfectly.

I highly doubt they'd risk everything for 1 paycheck. As long as Facebook knows everything about you they're going to continue to make billions and billions with relatively low overhead. If something like what you're saying became public Facebook would experience a fallout like they've never seen before.

What makes more sense is that various other apps are spying on you and sending that data to Facebook. 

Using their analytics you can pretty much send them anything and they will keep track of the user for you. This makes buying new customers a lot easier. For example say John Smith buys 100$ worth of IAPs in my game, I decide this guys a whale and I track him more closely. Everything he does in my app can be important (in theory) so I send it all to Facebook. Then I fire up a campaign on Facebook and I tell Facebook only show my ads to users that are very similar to this guy based on all the info I gave you as well as all the info you have stored for that user. Then Facebook looks for people that match all those params and my advertising base should all be whales.

Now just think if I had the ability to track your conversations. All I currently know about you is stuff you've done in the game but nothing else. After listening to you I realize you're an avid gun owner and enjoy whisky. I take that data and compare it to other whales in my app and realize they too love guns, but not so much whisky. Now I'm starting to sense a trend about gun lovers and my app, I have no idea what the correlation is but I don't care I just want 100$ whales playing my game. So I dig deeper and deeper and recoding everything I think is useable. The whole time I'm sending that data to Facebook and they're thanking me for doing all the dirty work for them while they keep their hands clean.

This is a hypothetical situation, but it's exactly how it works. It's called Lookalike audiences. I once went to a big data conference where they said candy crush has over 2 million tracking points in their game just so they can fully understand you as a whole."

WinEpic,1509325006.0,1,"Personal opinion based on experience with both companies' services. Google at least lets you see your history, and they tend to be more open about collecting user data. Google Assistant being able to record what you're saying before and after the activation phrase isn't hidden behind a long EULA, it's right there when you activate the always-on listening. You can go online and see all the data Google has on you, and they actually use it for your convenience (like with Location History).

Obviously they're in the business of making money, like everyone else, and I wouldn't be surprised if they monitored more than they let us know, but their strategy seems to be to collect information on their users to make their life easier, and making money by selling the rights to use that information to advertisers.

Meanwhile, it seems like Amazon is just collecting data to make you spend as much money as possible. You could say they're doing the same thing as google by proactively showing me products I seem to be interested in, but it definitely feels like they're pushing you towards impulse-buying more shit. 

Example - I was debating getting a new monitor, and doing some research. Amazon kept sending me follow-up emails and showing me ads about the specific monitor I wanted, pushing me to buy it as much as possible. Meanwhile Google showed a card saying something like ""It looks like you're researching monitors, here are models and news you might be interested in"". And most of that was actually decently helpful information.

Both companies are collecting absurd amount of data on their users, but Google is ever so slightly less opaque about what they're doing with it. And they're not blatantly taking advantage of their users - a good example would be the Echo suggesting you to buy shit."

I can tell you from personal experience that I have witnessed what has been described in this thread happening.  A friend was chatting with me while he was in Facebook on his iPhone.  He was talking about NYC and the various things there that were so much better than what we have locally.  One of the examples he gave was a shoe repair guy.  He looked back down at his phone, scrolled it and suddenly he sees a bunch of shoe repair shop ads in his feed.  

Personally I have no use for Facebook and have no interest in creating an account.  So can't say I have had this happen to me.  But I will say every time I see him using facebook I start talking about the weirdest shit I can think of to see how it affects his feed :)"

If they do that to someone after a unified chip implant has become standard/required, nobody can do anything, because everything can theoretically be shut down at the press of a button.

I'm not saying I believe this will be a thing. But this is what people who fear the whole chip idea are actually afraid of. It has nothing/very little to do with tracking your whereabouts, and more the ability to completely control your life since your entire identity/livelihood will be on a single chip that can be disabled at the drop of a hat."

ryao,1509355192.0,1,"There are people at Facebook whose job is to make sure that ads shown turn into clicks. They are going to come up with creative ways to pepper people with numerous ads where one of them likely is one that has some meaning to them, even if they do not know which one it is for a given individual. They can even go based on search trends to see what might be hot at a given point in time. They do not have to be using your microphone to listen to you. If you think that they are, try examining network traffic or ask your doctor for names of rare poorly known diseases that have extremely expensive treatments and start talking about them around your phone.

Seeing an ad for a mundane thing like a TV series or cat food is just extremely likely to happen to some people who discussed it by random chance. Something truly rare like a treatment for 1 in a million illness would be evidence to suggest that people examine the app (which likely will happen anyway), although it would not be proof either. A study where several hundred people who think that their phones are bugged by advertisers start talking about extremely rare illnesses (or other rare things that have ad campaigns) and see ads would be more convincing.

Of course, if this were happening, a hacker would have likely already posted evidence. Facebook has far too many enemies for proof of something like this not to have been caught and sent to the media. Google and MySpace for instance would both love to catch Facebook doing something like this."

dmglakewood,1509325279.0,1,"Oh if you believe most things you do is because you want to do it or it was your idea, you're sadly mistaken. I've worked for fortune 500 companies and it's all about manipulating the user to get the result. An obvious version of this is travel sites. If you're looking for cheap flights and flight x is 299$, they know exactly what flight you're after. A few days later you look at the flight it's now 350$...""omg the price went up, I better buy now to make sure it doesn't go up again"". Little did you know that was all fake. The price was manipulated to play with your emotions and get you to buy now. If you browse the same site incognito it would have been the same price on both days. 

The ways things are worded, the prices, the feeling of getting a deal etc etc it's all heavily calculated to get the result. In fact I've seen campaigns where they raise the price 25% and then tell the user they get 5% off if they buy today. The user ended up paying 20% more, but the conversion rate went up quite a bit.

The larger the company is typically the better they are at getting to know you. The better they know you the easier it is to manipulate you.

It sounds terrible, but at the end of the day if you get the product at what you feel is a discount and you think the whole thing was your idea....is it really all that bad?"

I would argue that any method of making a profit that does not actually generate a public good is not something that should be widespread in a society, and this should be curtailed via regulation. That's why printing counterfeit money, or buying up the competition to become a monopoly, are both illegal. 








I would say that yes, manipulating people into buying your product above market value by playing on their fears and prejudices, etc. Is an unethical thing to do. It doesn't matter whether or not it feels consensual on their part, they're still being cheated."

And ultimately, I just don't see what public benefit targeted ads serve that makes them so important and worth saving in the first place. Or at least, it seems so small to me, if it exists at all, that it's just not as important as the procedural cleanliness afforded by banning this type of recording altogether.

As for doing what you describe, Google backdoored every Android device that uses the Google Play Store. The backdoor gives them the ability to do what you describe (by them covertly loading an app or special update to do it) but nobody has caught them in the act. I find it highly unlikely that they would use such a sophisticated backdoor to do something so mundane.
